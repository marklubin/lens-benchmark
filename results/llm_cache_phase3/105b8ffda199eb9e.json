The elevated latency therefore coincides with heavy compaction pressure and an aggressive rebalance window.\n\n* **2026\u201101\u201110 (dx\u202f069)** \u2013 Latency again spikes (cluster_capacity\u202fp95\u202f=\u202f250\u202fms,\u202fnode_utilization\u202fp95\u202f=\u202f200\u202fms,\u202frebalance\u202fp95\u202f=\u202f220\u202fms,\u202fcompaction\u202fp95\u202f=\u202f210\u202fms)\u202f[ref_id\u202fcascading_failure_01_dx_069].

Look at daily summaries maybe include latency metrics like p95/p99 for storage endpoints. The question likely refers to service latency spikes observed elsewhere (maybe in other services). Need to see if rebalance or compaction metrics show high latency.\n\nFrom documents we have endpoint performance for storage endpoints with p95/p99 latencies. For example, on 2026-01-10 (dx_069) latencies are higher: cluster_capacity p95 250ms, node_utilization p95 200ms, rebalance p95 220ms, compaction p95 210ms. That's higher than other days where latencies are low (e.g., dx_065 has p95 ~25ms). So there is a spike on that day. Also alerts show hottest node, rebalance activity increased.\n\nThus we can claim correlation: on 2026-01-10, both rebalance and compaction latencies spiked, coinciding with service latency spikes (higher p95). Also other days with high rebalance throughput (dx_065) but latencies low. Need to compare.\n\nCheck dx_065: rebalance p95 22ms, compaction p95 20ms, low latency. So spikes not present.\n\nThus correlation appears on days with high utilization and rebalance/compaction pressure (dx_069). Provide answer citing dx_069 and maybe dx_062 where compaction backlog and rebalance increased but latencies moderate (p95 250ms for cluster capacity). Actually dx_062 has higher latencies: cluster_capacity p95 250ms, node_utilization p95 100ms, rebalance p95 180ms, compaction p95 160ms. That's also a spike. So yes correlation.\n\nThus answer: Yes, storage rebalance and compaction activity coincide with latency spikes, as seen on 2026-01-03 (dx_062) and 2026-01-10 (dx_069) where p95 latencies rose alongside increased rebalance and compaction times and alerts about hot nodes and backlog.
