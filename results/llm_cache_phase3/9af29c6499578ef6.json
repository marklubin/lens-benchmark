We need to infer from memory entries what actions are recommended to prevent recurrence. Likely multiple actions: implement commit hooks, change checklists, peer review, zone-level locking, disable console edits, enable retry jitter, add monitoring alerts, rotate keys, etc.\n\nWe need to synthesize a set of actions: post-incident review, update change process, add guardrails, implement commit hooks, enforce peer review, enable zone-level locking, disable console edits for production, add retry jitter, monitor TSIG key lifecycle, add alerts for recurring issues, schedule regular audits.\n\nWe must cite each claim with reference IDs.\n\nLet's gather relevant docs: commit hook (dx_048), change checklist (dx_012), zone-level locking (dx_037), disable console edits (dx_042), retry jitter (ep_024), TSIG key lifecycle controls (dx_055), monitoring alerts (ep_018), post-incident review (dx_012). Also maybe \"prevent configuration errors\" (dx_048). Use batch retrieve to get full details? Might not need full.\n\nWe have enough citations.\n\nNow craft answer: The team should conduct post-incident review, update change management checklist, enforce peer review, implement commit hooks to block invalid DNS records, add zone-level locking in cloud sync controller, disable console edits for production zones, enable retry jitter, add alerts for connection pool exhaustion, add preventive controls for TSIG key lifecycle, schedule regular audits, and monitor with alerts.\n\nProvide concise bullet list with citations.\n\n"
