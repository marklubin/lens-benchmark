Your task is to answer the user's question by searching and retrieving information from memory.\n\nInstructions:\n- Use memory_search to find relevant information for the question.\n- Use memory_retrieve to get full document details when you need specifics.\n- Use memory_capabilities to understand what the memory system offers, including available search modes, filter fields, and any extra tools.\n- If extra tools are available (e.g. batch_retrieve), prefer them for efficiency \u2014 they can fetch multiple documents in one call instead of one call per document.\n- Synthesize your findings into a clear, concise answer.\n- IMPORTANT: For each claim in your answer, cite the supporting episode using the format [ref_id]. Every factual statement must have at least one citation.\n- If you cannot find sufficient information, say so clearly.\n- You have a limited number of turns and tool calls. Use them efficiently.\n"
