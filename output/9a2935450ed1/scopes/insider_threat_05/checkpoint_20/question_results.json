The trajectory shows **escalating and sustained risk behavior**, warranting immediate investigation [ref_id: compaction_summary].",

Red team accounts (`redteam-1`, `redteam-2`, `redteam-3`) triggered alerts involving encrypted archives, sensitive keywords, and cloud uploads, primarily to `box.com` and `sharepoint.com`.

While red team activity contributed to alert volume, jmorris\\u2019s behavior persisted post-exercise and included **multiple blocked HIGH-severity transfers**, indicating potential data exfiltration attempts. **sbrown** and **hkim** also exhibit concerning patterns warranting review. Immediate investigation into jmorris\\u2019s activity, access privileges, and endpoint logs is recommended.\", \"metadata\": {}}], \"count\": 1}",

This assessment is based on multiple converging indicators of potential insider threat behavior.\n\njmorris triggered **12+ high-severity Data Loss Prevention (DLP) alerts** between September 10 and September 21, 2024, including repeated violations for `ENCRYPTED_ARCHIVE_DETECT`, `SENSITIVE_KEYWORD_MATCH`, and `CLOUD_UPLOAD_POLICY` to external services like `box.com` [compaction_summary]. On September 19 alone, jmorris triggered **6 DLP alerts, 3 of which were HIGH-severity**, all involving blocked or logged transfers to `box.com` [compaction_summary].\n\nThis activity is coupled with **anomalous data access and download behavior**, including access to legacy and sensitive repositories such as `project-atlas/firmware` and `project-sentinel/radar`, which are not commonly accessed [compaction_summary]. Download volumes escalated significantly, from 187.7 MB on September 10 to **1048.1 MB on September 21** [compaction_summary].\n\nAdditionally, jmorris exhibited **suspicious after-hours activity**, with multiple long-duration VPN sessions (e.g., 3.0 hours on September 19), during which over 500 MB of data was transferred [compaction_summary]. Notably, jmorris accessed restricted physical locations\u2014**Lab A and Server Room\u2014on a weekend**, which is unusual for non-oncall staff [compaction_summary]. Multiple USB storage attempts were also blocked during this period [compaction_summary].\n\nWhile other users like **sbrown** and **hkim** show elevated risk indicators, jmorris\u2019s pattern is the most severe and sustained, involving **repeated high-severity policy violations, large-scale data access, off-hours activity, and physical access to secure areas** [compaction_summary]. The conclusion from the summary explicitly identifies jmorris as exhibiting a **\"sustained, high-risk pattern\"** with potential data exfiltration attempts, warranting immediate investigation [compaction_summary].",

Red team accounts (`redteam-1`, `redteam-2`, `redteam-3`) triggered alerts involving encrypted archives, sensitive keywords, and cloud uploads, primarily to `box.com` and `sharepoint.com`. After exercise conclusion on 2024-09-17, alert volume normalized to 19\\u201322 per day [insider_threat_05_ep_017].\\n\\nDespite red team noise, **jmorris** consistently triggered high-severity DLP alerts:\\n- **12+ alerts** from jmorris between 2024-09-10 and 2024-09-21.\\n- Multiple **HIGH-severity** triggers: `ENCRYPTED_ARCHIVE_DETECT` (e.g., `.dwg`, `.pdf`), `SENSITIVE_KEYWORD_MATCH`, and `CLOUD_UPLOAD_POLICY` to `box.com` [insider_threat_05_ep_017, insider_threat_05_ep_018, insider_threat_05_ep_019, insider_threat_05_ep_020].\\n- On 2024-09-19, jmorris triggered **6 DLP alerts**, including **3 HIGH-severity** events, all blocked or logged for `box.com` transfers [insider_threat_05_ep_018].\\n- SOC notes repeatedly flagged jmorris: \\u201c5 from single user under review\\u201d (2024-09-18), \\u201c6 from single user under review\\u201d (2024-09-19) [insider_threat_05_ep_017, insider_threat_05_ep_018].\\n\\n#### **2. Data Access and Download Behavior**\\n- **jmorris** exhibited anomalous access patterns:\\n  - Accessed **legacy and archived projects** (e.g., `archive/project-nova-2021`, `project-beacon/firmware-legacy`, `project-sentinel/radar`) not commonly accessed by others.\\n  - Downloaded **increasing volumes**: 78 files (187.7 MB) on 2024-09-10 \\u2192 133 files (1048.1 MB) on 2024-09-21 [insider_threat_05_ep_010, insider_threat_05_ep_020].\\n  - Consistently accessed **sensitive repos**: `project-atlas/firmware`, `project-atlas/schematics`, `project-beacon/rf-modules`.\\n- **sbrown** showed elevated USB and external transfer activity:\\n  - Multiple `SENSITIVE_KEYWORD_MATCH` and `EXTERNAL_TRANSFER_POLICY` alerts, including `.iges`, `.dwg`, and `.7z` files to `local_usb`, `email_attachment`, and `onedrive.com` [insider_threat_05_ep_001, insider_threat_05_ep_005, insider_threat_05_ep_015].\\n  - USB storage device blocked on 2024-09-02, but USB printer allowed on 2024-09-09 [insider_threat_05_ep_001, insider_threat_05_ep_009].\\n- **hkim** and **rjohnson** also triggered repeated medium-to-high severity DLP events, particularly for `.dwg`, `.iges`, and `.tar.gz` files.\\n\\n#### **3.

While red team activity contributed to alert volume, jmorris\\u2019s behavior persisted post-exercise and included **multiple blocked HIGH-severity transfers**, indicating potential data exfiltration attempts. **sbrown** and **hkim** also exhibit concerning patterns warranting review. Immediate investigation into jmorris\\u2019s activity, access privileges, and endpoint logs is recommended.\", \"metadata\": {}}], \"count\": 1}",

Instead, the activity is highly anomalous and centered on a single user, **jmorris**, who exhibited:\n\n- Repeated high-severity DLP alerts (12+ between 2024-09-10 and 2024-09-21), including **ENCRYPTED_ARCHIVE_DETECT** and **CLOUD_UPLOAD_POLICY** violations to `box.com` [ref_id: compaction_summary].\n- Access to **legacy and archived projects** (e.g., `archive/project-nova-2021`, `project-beacon/firmware-legacy`) not commonly accessed by others, suggesting non-standard work [ref_id: compaction_summary].\n- A sharp increase in download volume: from 187.7 MB (78 files) on 2024-09-10 to **1048.1 MB (133 files)** on 2024-09-21, far exceeding normal project needs [ref_id: compaction_summary].\n- Frequent **after-hours VPN sessions** (e.g., 3.0 hours on 2024-09-19) with large data transfers (>500 MB in a single session) [ref_id: compaction_summary].\n- **Weekend physical access** to restricted areas like Lab A and Server Room, unusual for non-oncall staff [ref_id: compaction_summary].\n- Multiple **blocked USB storage attempts** and high-severity cloud upload blocks, indicating policy circumvention attempts [ref_id: compaction_summary].\n\nThese behaviors deviate significantly from what would be expected in a legitimate project and instead align with potential data exfiltration [ref_id: compaction_summary].
