This user triggered DLP alerts on 7 out of 12 days, indicating unusually high activity compared to peers [compaction_summary].\n\n- **sbrown** demonstrates volume anomalies in after-hours access, with 6 recorded VPN sessions, including a 2.4-hour session transferring over 131 million bytes [insider_threat_05_ep_011]. This pattern exceeds typical peer behavior during off-hours.\n\n- **kwilson** also exhibits volume anomalies, with a peak after-hours session of 2.4 hours transferring over 164 million bytes [insider_threat_05_ep_012], and accessed the Server Room on 2024-09-10 [insider_threat_05_ep_010], suggesting elevated access levels.\n\n- **agarcia** transferred 191,352,780 bytes via VPN on 2024-09-07 [insider_threat_05_ep_007] and accessed the Server Room three times during the monitoring period [insider_threat_05_ep_005, insider_threat_05_ep_006, insider_threat_05_ep_010], indicating both volume and scope deviations.\n\nThese behaviors\u2014particularly the combination of frequent DLP triggers, access to sensitive or legacy systems, and high data transfer volumes outside normal hours\u2014represent notable anomalies when compared to peer group baselines [compaction_summary].",
