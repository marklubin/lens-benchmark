Access times and durations align with regular business hours (e.g., sbrown [insider_threat_05_ep_001] accessed systems from 07:54\u201317:11), and badge swipes confirm physical presence (e.g., sbrown swiped at Lab B at 07:48 [insider_threat_05_ep_001]).\n\n- DLP alerts are present but mostly low severity:\n  - sbrown triggered two alerts: DLP-20240902-1703 (FILE_SIZE_THRESHOLD, .iges to local_usb, LOW) and DLP-20240902-4764 (SENSITIVE_KEYWORD_MATCH, .pdf to local_usb, LOW) [insider_threat_05_ep_001]. The blocked USB_STORAGE event for sbrown at 09:03 [insider_threat_05_ep_001] indicates policy enforcement was effective.\n  - jmorris triggered DLP-20240902-3953 (FILE_SIZE_THRESHOLD, .zip to sharepoint.com, MEDIUM) and had a blocked USB_HID device at 12:28 [insider_threat_05_ep_001], but no evidence of data exfiltration.\n  - dlee triggered DLP-20240902-5972 (FILE_SIZE_THRESHOLD, .iges to email_attachment, MEDIUM) [insider_threat_05_ep_001], which is more concerning but isolated.\n  - lpatel and tchen triggered BULK_DOWNLOAD_POLICY alerts (DLP-20240902-6602 and DLP-20240902-3069), both to sharepoint.com, which may be legitimate collaboration.\n\n- Post-hours VPN sessions (e.g., agarcia 19:06\u201321:23, hkim 19:04\u201321:16 [insider_threat_05_ep_001]) show data transfer but within plausible work boundaries and no associated high-severity alerts.\n\n- Patch compliance is high (93.5%), malware is minimal (5 samples, AgentTesla detected), and firewall changes were authorized.\n\nWhile there are **anomalous behaviors**\u2014particularly sbrown\u2019s local USB attempts and dlee\u2019s email attachment of a large .iges file\u2014none constitute clear malicious intent or policy breach without further context. The DLP system logged but did not block most actions, and technical controls (e.g., USB blocking) functioned as intended.\n\n**Conclusion**: Current data reflects policy alerts and edge-case behaviors, but no conclusive evidence of insider threat or data exfiltration. **Escalation is not yet warranted**, but **sbrown and dlee should be flagged for behavioral monitoring**. If similar or more severe events recur, escalation would be justified.",

The scope and trajectory of this activity suggest **potential insider data handling risks**, with multiple low-to-medium severity DLP alerts, USB blocking events, and after-hours VPN sessions indicating possible data staging or unauthorized transfer attempts.\n\n### Scope of Anomalous Activity\n\n1. **Multiple Users Involved with Project-Atlas and Project-Beacon Assets**  \n   Several users accessed repositories related to *project-atlas* (schematics, firmware, test-harness) and *project-beacon* (rf-modules), which appear to be high-value engineering projects. Notably:\n   - **sbrown** accessed four repositories including both project-atlas and project-beacon assets, downloaded 169.4 MB across 40 files, and triggered **two DLP alerts**:\n     - `DLP-20240902-1703`: Transfer of a large `.iges` file (CAD format) to **local_usb**, triggering *FILE_SIZE_THRESHOLD* [insider_threat_05_ep_001].\n     - `DLP-20240902-4764`: A `.pdf` file containing **sensitive keywords** copied to **local_usb** [insider_threat_05_ep_001].\n   - Additionally, **sbrown** swiped into **Lab B at 07:48**, earlier than most, suggesting early access to physical facilities [insider_threat_05_ep_001].\n\n2. **USB Device Blocking Events Indicate Attempted Physical Exfiltration**  \n   Three USB block events occurred:\n   - **hkim**: USB_PRINTER blocked at 07:34 \u2014 early in the day, possibly pre-authorized but logged [insider_threat_05_ep_001].\n   - **jmorris**: USB_HID (keyboard/mouse) blocked at 12:28 \u2014 likely false positive or misclassified device [insider_threat_05_ep_001].\n   - **sbrown**: **USB_STORAGE device blocked at 09:03** \u2014 directly following access to sensitive repos and preceding DLP alerts involving local_usb. This is a **high-risk indicator** of attempted data exfiltration [insider_threat_05_ep_001].\n\n3. **DLP Alerts Show Patterns of Bulk and Sensitive Data Handling**  \n   Of the 7 displayed DLP alerts (out of 13 org-wide), 6 involve engineering file types (.step, .iges, .7z, .zip, .pdf) and cloud/email/local transfers:\n   - **jmorris**: `.zip` file sent to *sharepoint.com* \u2014 triggered *FILE_SIZE_THRESHOLD* (MEDIUM) [DLP-20240902-3953].\n   - **lpatel**: BULK_DOWNLOAD_POLICY triggered uploading `.step` files (CAD) to *sharepoint.com* (MEDIUM) [DLP-20240902-6602].\n   - **dlee**: `.iges` file sent via **email_attachment** \u2014 MEDIUM severity, indicating potential external sharing [DLP-20240902-5972].\n   - **tchen** and **mzhang**: Both uploaded `.7z` archives to *sharepoint.com*, triggering BULK/CLOUD policies (LOW) [DLP-20240902-3069, DLP-20240902-5648].\n\n4. **After-Hours Access via VPN Suggests Extended Work or Data Exfiltration Window**  \n   Five users connected to the corporate network after normal working hours:\n   - **agarcia** (2.3 hrs, 118.8 MB), **hkim** (2.2 hrs, 53.0 MB), **kwilson** (1.4 hrs, 184.3 MB \u2014 highest data transfer), **nwilliams**, and **tchen** [insider_threat_05_ep_001].\n   - **kwilson** transferred **184.3 MB** during a short session \u2014 the largest among VPN users \u2014 while accessing *project-beacon/rf-modules* and *project-atlas/test-harness*, suggesting possible data retrieval outside core hours.\n\n### Trajectory of Activity\n\n- **Morning Entry and Early Access**: Users like **sbrown (07:48)** and **dlee (07:30)** began work early, with",

Below is a breakdown of the key risk indicators:\n\n1. **sbrown** exhibits multiple high-risk behaviors:\n   - Triggered **two DLP alerts**:\n     - [DLP-20240902-1703]: Transferred a large `.iges` file (common CAD format) to **local_usb**, which was **blocked** per policy. This indicates attempted exfiltration of engineering data via removable media.\n     - [DLP-20240902-4764]: Triggered a **SENSITIVE_KEYWORD_MATCH** on a `.pdf` file also destined for **local_usb**, suggesting potential data leakage of confidential documentation.\n   - Badge swipe at **Lab B at 07:48** [insider_threat_05_ep_001], aligning with early access and possible physical tampering or data transfer.\n   - USB_STORAGE device **blocked at 09:03** [insider_threat_05_ep_001], directly correlating with the DLP alerts and confirming an active attempt to use unauthorized removable storage.\n\n   These actions suggest **intentional data exfiltration attempts**, elevating sbrown\u2019s risk to **high**.\n\n2. **jmorris** shows concerning behavior:\n   - Triggered [DLP-20240902-3953]: **FILE_SIZE_THRESHOLD** violation uploading a `.zip` file to **sharepoint.com**. While SharePoint is corporate, unapproved large file uploads may indicate data aggregation.\n   - USB_HID device **blocked at 12:28** [insider_threat_05_ep_001], which could indicate an attempt to use a malicious input device (e.g., Rubber Ducky), suggesting **potential insider threat or compromise**.\n   - Accessed **project-atlas/test-harness**, **schematics**, and **documentation**, indicating access to sensitive R&D assets.\n\n   Combined, this suggests **moderate to high risk**, especially given the physical security bypass attempt.\n\n3. **dlee**:\n   - Triggered [DLP-20240902-5972]: **FILE_SIZE_THRESHOLD** alert for a `.iges` file sent as an **email attachment**, a known exfiltration vector. Severity: **MEDIUM**.\n   - Accessed **all four major project repositories**, including firmware and test-harness, indicating broad access privileges.\n   - Longest access time range (07:30\u201317:29) and high download volume (148.4 MB), suggesting **intensive data handling**.\n\n   This behavior raises **moderate risk**, particularly due to email-based transfer of large engineering files.\n\n4. **lpatel**:\n   - Triggered [DLP-20240902-6602]: **BULK_DOWNLOAD_POLICY** violation uploading `.step` files (CAD format) to **sharepoint.com**. While cloud storage is allowed, bulk downloads of design files may indicate data aggregation for unauthorized use.\n   - Accessed **project-atlas/firmware** and **schematics**, core intellectual property.\n\n   Risk level: **moderate**, due to bulk handling of sensitive design data.\n\n5. **Other users** (e.g., tchen, mzhang) triggered low-severity DLP alerts (e.g., [DLP-20240902-3069], [DLP-20240902-5648]) for `.7z` uploads to SharePoint, which may be routine but warrant monitoring for pattern escalation.\n\n**Conclusion**: The most significant risks stem from **sbrown** and **jmorris**, with **sbrown** posing the **highest risk** due to repeated, policy-violating attempts to transfer sensitive files to **local USB**, a classic insider threat indicator. The combination of **DLP alerts**, **blocked USB events**, and **early physical access** strongly suggests **malicious intent or compromised behavior**. Immediate investigation and access revocation for sbrown are recommended. Overall, the anomalous activity across multiple users indicates a **moderate to high organizational risk**, particularly around IP protection and insider threats.",
