All stations recorded parameters including pH, DO, turbidity, temperature, conductivity, heavy metals (Cr, Pb, Cd, Hg, As), and biological indicators. A significant and escalating chromium (Cr) anomaly was detected at WQ-03 starting June 9, peaking at 58 \\u00b5g/L on June 19, with downstream propagation. Concurrent agricultural runoff events elevated turbidity and nutrients at WQ-04 and WQ-05. Despite thermal and hydrological fluctuations, most parameters remained within seasonal baselines except for Cr at WQ-03, which triggered compliance warnings.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Key Trends and Anomalies**\\n\\n#### **1. Chromium (Cr) Anomaly at WQ-03**\\n- **Baseline Cr levels**: 2\\u20135 \\u00b5g/L across all stations [ep001\\u2013ep008].\\n- **Onset**: Cr at WQ-03 rose to **12 \\u00b5g/L on June 9** [ep009], while upstream stations (WQ-01, WQ-02) remained at baseline.\\n- **Progression**:\\n  - June 10: **14 \\u00b5g/L** [ep010]\\n  - June 11: **15 \\u00b5g/L** [ep011]\\n  - June 12: **17 \\u00b5g/L** [ep012]\\n  - June 13: **16 \\u00b5g/L** [ep013]\\n  - June 14: **18 \\u00b5g/L** [ep014]\\n  - June 15: **15 \\u00b5g/L** [ep015]\\n  - June 16: **42 \\u00b5g/L** [ep016]\\n  - June 17: **48 \\u00b5g/L** [ep017]\\n  - June 18: **52 \\u00b5g/L** [ep018]\\n  - June 19: **58 \\u00b5g/L** (peak) [ep019]\\n  - June 20: **55 \\u00b5g/L** [ep020]\\n- **Compliance Status**: Cr at WQ-03 exceeded background by >10x and approached the MCL of 100 \\u00b5g/L, triggering **compliance warnings on June 18\\u201320** [ep018\\u2013ep020].\\n- **Spatial Gradient**: Cr decreased downstream: WQ-04 (37.5 \\u00b5g/L max) \\u2192 WQ-05 (24.9 \\u00b5g/L) \\u2192 WQ-06 (15.8 \\u00b5g/L) [ep019], indicating dilution but persistent contamination.\\n- **Upstream Stations**: WQ-01 and WQ-02 Cr levels remained stable (2\\u20135 \\u00b5g/L), ruling out basin-wide source [ep009\\u2013ep020].\\n\\n#### **2. Agricultural Runoff Impact (WQ-04/WQ-05)**\\n- **Turbidity Spikes**:\\n  - June 14: WQ-04 = **45 NTU**, WQ-05 = **32 NTU** [ep014]\\n  - June 15: WQ-04 = **48 NTU**, WQ-05 = **35 NTU** [ep015]\\n  - June 16: WQ-04 = **42 NTU**, WQ-05 = **30 NTU** [ep016]\\n- **Field Observations**: Agricultural runoff visible from drainage tiles; corn/soybean fields in active cultivation [ep014\\u2013ep016].\\n- **Nutrient Correlation**: On June 15, WQ-04 recorded **nitrate = 8.2 mg/L**, **phosphate = 0.9 mg/L**, suggesting fertilizer leaching [ep015].\\n- **Temporal Link**: Runoff events followed rainfall on June 14 (0.45 in) and preceded Cr escalation at WQ-03, suggesting possible mobilization of contaminants.\\n\\n#### **3. Conductivity and Temperature Trends**\\n- **Conductivity**:\\n  - Gradual increase from **280 \\u00b5S/cm (June 1)** to **408 \\u00b5S/cm (June 20)** at WQ-03 [ep001, ep020].\\n  - WQ-03 consistently recorded **5\\u201315 \\u00b5S/cm higher** than adjacent stations, indicating localized ionic input [ep009\\u2013ep020].\\n- **Temperature**:\\n  - Daily average rose from **18.5\\u00b0C (June 1)** to **23.0\\u00b0C (June 16\\u201318)** [ep001, ep016].\\n  - High air temps (up to 92\\u00b0F) on June 9 and 16 correlated with thermal stress; fish kill reported near WQ-04 on June 5 and 15, attributed to heat [ep005, ep015].\\n\\n#### **4. Dissolved Oxygen (DO) and pH**\\n- **DO**:\\n  - WQ-03 DO declined as Cr increased: from **8.3 mg/L (June 3)** to **5.9 mg/L (June 20)** [ep003, ep020].\\n  - Inverse correlation with Cr suggests biological or chemical oxygen demand from contaminant.\\n- **pH**:\\n  - WQ-03 pH dropped from **7.3 (June 3)** to **6.5 (June 18)** [ep003, ep018], while other stations remained 7.2\\u20137.7.\\n  - Acidification at WQ-03 may indicate acid mine drainage or organic acid release.\\n\\n#### **5. Biological Indicators**\\n- **Algal Bloom Index**:\\n  - Peaked at **1.8 on June 6 and 14** [ep006, ep014], coinciding with agricultural runoff.\\n  - Chlorophyll a reached **12.0 \\u00b5g/L on June 12** [ep012], supporting bloom activity.\\n- **E. coli**:\\n  - Fluctuated between **38\\u2013195 CFU/100ml**, with no sustained exceedance of recreational thresholds.\\n  - Lowest on June 7 (**38 CFU/100ml**) [ep007], highest on June 1 (**193 CFU/100ml**) [ep001].\\n\\n#### **6. Sediment and Benthic Health**\\n- **Benthic Macroinvertebrate Index (BMI)**:\\n  - Ranged from **5.0 (June 3)** to **8.5 (June 8)** [ep003, ep008].\\n  - High BMI (>7) on June 8, 14, 18\\u201319 suggests resilient communities despite stressors [ep008, ep014, ep018\\u2013ep019].\\n- **Sediment Organic Carbon**:\\n  - Varied from **1.52% (June 13)** to **3.45% (June 5)** [ep013, ep005], with no clear trend.\\n- **Grain Size D50**:\\n  - Shifted from **0.67 mm (June 3)** to **0.1 mm (June 14)** [ep003, ep014], indicating finer sediment deposition during runoff.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Events and Operational Notes**\\n- **Maintenance**: Routine probe cleaning, battery replacements, and firmware updates performed without data loss [ep001, ep002, ep007].\\n- **Infrastructure**: Beaver dam noted upstream of WQ-02 on June 6 and 16; partial obstruction but no flow impact [ep006, ep016].\\n- **Human Activity**: Bridge construction near WQ-03 reported on June 9 and 19; equipment flagged for protection [ep009, ep019].\\n- **QA/QC**: Monthly blanks submitted June 8; all below detection [ep008].\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Conclusion**\\nThe monitoring period revealed two co-occurring stressors: (1) a localized, escalating Cr contamination at WQ-03, likely from an upstream point source mobilized or exacerbated by agricultural practices, and (2) seasonal agricultural runoff increasing turbidity and nutrients at WQ-04/WQ-05.

All stations recorded parameters including pH, DO, turbidity, temperature, conductivity, heavy metals (Cr, Pb, Cd, Hg, As), and biological indicators. A significant and escalating chromium (Cr) anomaly was detected at WQ-03 starting June 9, peaking at 58 \\u00b5g/L on June 19, with downstream propagation. Concurrent agricultural runoff events elevated turbidity and nutrients at WQ-04 and WQ-05.
