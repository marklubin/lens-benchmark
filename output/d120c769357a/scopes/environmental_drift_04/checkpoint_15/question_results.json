Chromium (Cr) Anomaly at WQ-03**\\nA consistent and concerning elevation in Cr levels was observed at **WQ-03**, beginning on **2024-06-09** and persisting through **2024-06-15**:\\n- **WQ-03 Cr levels**: 12 \\u00b5g/L [ep_009], 14 \\u00b5g/L [ep_010], 15 \\u00b5g/L [ep_011], 17 \\u00b5g/L [ep_012], 16 \\u00b5g/L [ep_013], 18 \\u00b5g/L [ep_014], 15 \\u00b5g/L [ep_015]\\n- Upstream stations **WQ-01** and **WQ-02** showed stable Cr levels (2\\u20135 \\u00b5g/L), indicating a localized source near or at WQ-03.\\n- **WQ-04** and **WQ-05** also showed elevated Cr (7.6\\u201311.1 \\u00b5g/L), decreasing downstream, suggesting downstream transport.\\n- **WQ-06** Cr levels remained low (3.5\\u20134.7 \\u00b5g/L), indicating dilution or settling.\\n- **Potential cause**: Bridge construction activity noted near WQ-03 on 2024-06-09 [ep_009] may be contributing to localized contamination.\\n\\n#### **2. Agricultural Runoff Event (2024-06-14\\u201315)**\\nA significant runoff event affected **WQ-04** and **WQ-05**, linked to recent precipitation and agricultural activity:\\n- **Turbidity spike**: WQ-04: 45 NTU [ep_014], 48 NTU [ep_015]; WQ-05: 32 NTU [ep_014], 35 NTU [ep_015] \\u2014 far above baseline (3\\u20137 NTU).\\n- **Field notes**: Agricultural runoff visible from drainage tiles; corn/soybean fields in active cultivation [ep_014].\\n- **Nutrient indicators**: Nitrate 8.2 mg/L and phosphate 0.9 mg/L at WQ-04 [ep_015], suggesting nutrient loading.\\n- **Biological response**: Elevated *Chlorophyll a* (11.7 \\u00b5g/L [ep_014], 9.6 \\u00b5g/L [ep_015]) and Algal Bloom Index (1.7 [ep_014], 1.2 [ep_015]) indicate potential eutrophication risk.\\n- **No impact on upstream stations (WQ-01\\u201303)**, confirming localized source.\\n\\n#### **3. Temperature and Conductivity Drift**\\nA notable discontinuity occurred on **2024-06-11**:\\n- **Temperature**: Dropped from ~20.6\\u00b0C (2024-06-10) to 19.7\\u00b0C (2024-06-11) [ep_010 \\u2192 ep_011], despite rising air temperatures.\\n- **Conductivity**: Reset from 393 \\u00b5S/cm (WQ-03, 2024-06-10) to 285 \\u00b5S/cm (2024-06-11) [ep_010 \\u2192 ep_011], then resumed upward trend.\\n- **Likely cause**: Sensor recalibration or replacement. WQ-06 flow gauge was recalibrated on 2024-06-02 [ep_002], suggesting ongoing maintenance cycles.\\n\\n#### **4. Dissolved Oxygen (DO) and pH at WQ-03**\\nWQ-03 consistently showed lower DO and pH compared to other stations:\\n- **DO**: 6.7\\u20137.2 mg/L (vs. 7.5\\u20138.7 elsewhere) [ep_014, ep_015]\\n- **pH**: 6.8\\u20137.0 (vs. 7.2\\u20137.7 elsewhere) [ep_012\\u2013ep_015]\\n- **Possible causes**: Organic decay, localized pollution, or reduced reaeration due to beaver dam 200m upstream [ep_006].\\n\\n#### **5. Sediment and Biological Indicators**\\n- **Benthic Macroinvertebrate Index (BMI)**: Ranged from 5.0 [ep_003] to 8.5 [ep_008, ep_011], with higher values post-runoff (7.5 [ep_014], 7.1 [ep_015]), suggesting resilience.\\n- **Total Organic Carbon (TOC)**: Fluctuated (1.52\\u20133.45%), with peaks on 2024-06-05 (3.45%) [ep_005] and 2024-06-12 (3.08%) [ep_012], possibly linked to organic inputs.\\n- **E. coli**: Generally low (32\\u2013195 CFU/100ml), with highest on 2024-06-01 (193) [ep_001] and 2024-06-15 (158) [ep_015], but no exceedances of recreational standards.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Operational and Maintenance Events**\\n- **WQ-02 turbidity probe cleaned** on 2024-06-01 and 2024-06-11 [ep_001, ep_011] due to biofouling.\\n- **WQ-01 datalogger firmware updated** to v3.2.1 on 2024-06-02 and 2024-06-12 [ep_002, ep_012].\\n- **WQ-03 sonde serviced** on 2024-06-04 and 2024-06-14 [ep_004, ep_014].\\n- **WQ-04 conductivity probe swapped** on 2024-06-03 and 2024-06-13 [ep_003, ep_013].\\n- **Beaver dam** noted upstream of WQ-02 on 2024-06-06 [ep_006], possibly affecting flow and DO.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Weather and Hydrology**\\n- **Precipitation**: Two major events: 0.45 in (2024-06-04) and 0.45 in (2024-06-14), both followed by turbidity spikes at WQ-04/05.\\n- **Air temperature**: Peaked at 92\\u00b0F (2024-06-09) [ep_009], with heat stress suspected in fish kill near WQ-04 [ep_005, ep_015].\\n- **Flow**: USGS gauge recorded 14.2 cfs on 2024-06-05 and 2024-06-15 [ep_005, ep_015], and 16.8 cfs on 2024-06-09 [ep_009].\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Conclusion**\\nThe monitoring period revealed two key environmental stressors:\\n1. **Localized Cr contamination at WQ-03**, likely linked to bridge construction, requiring source investigation.\\n2. **Agricultural runoff** impacting WQ-04/05, with elevated turbidity, nutrients, and algal indicators, suggesting need for riparian buffer assessment.\\n\\nAll other parameters remained within seasonal norms.

All stations remained within seasonal baseline ranges for most parameters, with no compliance flags issued. Temperature and conductivity showed steady increases early in the series, followed by a sharp reset on 2024-06-11, likely due to calibration or sensor drift correction.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Key Trends and Patterns**\\n\\n#### **1. Chromium (Cr) Anomaly at WQ-03**\\nA consistent and concerning elevation in Cr levels was observed at **WQ-03**, beginning on **2024-06-09** and persisting through **2024-06-15**:\\n- **WQ-03 Cr levels**: 12 \\u00b5g/L [ep_009], 14 \\u00b5g/L [ep_010], 15 \\u00b5g/L [ep_011], 17 \\u00b5g/L [ep_012], 16 \\u00b5g/L [ep_013], 18 \\u00b5g/L [ep_014], 15 \\u00b5g/L [ep_015]\\n- Upstream stations **WQ-01** and **WQ-02** showed stable Cr levels (2\\u20135 \\u00b5g/L), indicating a localized source near or at WQ-03.\\n- **WQ-04** and **WQ-05** also showed elevated Cr (7.6\\u201311.1 \\u00b5g/L), decreasing downstream, suggesting downstream transport.\\n- **WQ-06** Cr levels remained low (3.5\\u20134.7 \\u00b5g/L), indicating dilution or settling.\\n- **Potential cause**: Bridge construction activity noted near WQ-03 on 2024-06-09 [ep_009] may be contributing to localized contamination.\\n\\n#### **2. Agricultural Runoff Event (2024-06-14\\u201315)**\\nA significant runoff event affected **WQ-04** and **WQ-05**, linked to recent precipitation and agricultural activity:\\n- **Turbidity spike**: WQ-04: 45 NTU [ep_014], 48 NTU [ep_015]; WQ-05: 32 NTU [ep_014], 35 NTU [ep_015] \\u2014 far above baseline (3\\u20137 NTU).\\n- **Field notes**: Agricultural runoff visible from drainage tiles; corn/soybean fields in active cultivation [ep_014].\\n- **Nutrient indicators**: Nitrate 8.2 mg/L and phosphate 0.9 mg/L at WQ-04 [ep_015], suggesting nutrient loading.\\n- **Biological response**: Elevated *Chlorophyll a* (11.7 \\u00b5g/L [ep_014], 9.6 \\u00b5g/L [ep_015]) and Algal Bloom Index (1.7 [ep_014], 1.2 [ep_015]) indicate potential eutrophication risk.\\n- **No impact on upstream stations (WQ-01\\u201303)**, confirming localized source.\\n\\n#### **3. Temperature and Conductivity Drift**\\nA notable discontinuity occurred on **2024-06-11**:\\n- **Temperature**: Dropped from ~20.6\\u00b0C (2024-06-10) to 19.7\\u00b0C (2024-06-11) [ep_010 \\u2192 ep_011], despite rising air temperatures.\\n- **Conductivity**: Reset from 393 \\u00b5S/cm (WQ-03, 2024-06-10) to 285 \\u00b5S/cm (2024-06-11) [ep_010 \\u2192 ep_011], then resumed upward trend.\\n- **Likely cause**: Sensor recalibration or replacement. WQ-06 flow gauge was recalibrated on 2024-06-02 [ep_002], suggesting ongoing maintenance cycles.\\n\\n#### **4. Dissolved Oxygen (DO) and pH at WQ-03**\\nWQ-03 consistently showed lower DO and pH compared to other stations:\\n- **DO**: 6.7\\u20137.2 mg/L (vs. 7.5\\u20138.7 elsewhere) [ep_014, ep_015]\\n- **pH**: 6.8\\u20137.0 (vs. 7.2\\u20137.7 elsewhere) [ep_012\\u2013ep_015]\\n- **Possible causes**: Organic decay, localized pollution, or reduced reaeration due to beaver dam 200m upstream [ep_006].\\n\\n#### **5. Sediment and Biological Indicators**\\n- **Benthic Macroinvertebrate Index (BMI)**: Ranged from 5.0 [ep_003] to 8.5 [ep_008, ep_011], with higher values post-runoff (7.5 [ep_014], 7.1 [ep_015]), suggesting resilience.\\n- **Total Organic Carbon (TOC)**: Fluctuated (1.52\\u20133.45%), with peaks on 2024-06-05 (3.45%) [ep_005] and 2024-06-12 (3.08%) [ep_012], possibly linked to organic inputs.\\n- **E. coli**: Generally low (32\\u2013195 CFU/100ml), with highest on 2024-06-01 (193) [ep_001] and 2024-06-15 (158) [ep_015], but no exceedances of recreational standards.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Operational and Maintenance Events**\\n- **WQ-02 turbidity probe cleaned** on 2024-06-01 and 2024-06-11 [ep_001, ep_011] due to biofouling.\\n- **WQ-01 datalogger firmware updated** to v3.2.1 on 2024-06-02 and 2024-06-12 [ep_002, ep_012].\\n- **WQ-03 sonde serviced** on 2024-06-04 and 2024-06-14 [ep_004, ep_014].\\n- **WQ-04 conductivity probe swapped** on 2024-06-03 and 2024-06-13 [ep_003, ep_013].\\n- **Beaver dam** noted upstream of WQ-02 on 2024-06-06 [ep_006], possibly affecting flow and DO.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Weather and Hydrology**\\n- **Precipitation**: Two major events: 0.45 in (2024-06-04) and 0.45 in (2024-06-14), both followed by turbidity spikes at WQ-04/05.\\n- **Air temperature**: Peaked at 92\\u00b0F (2024-06-09) [ep_009], with heat stress suspected in fish kill near WQ-04 [ep_005, ep_015].\\n- **Flow**: USGS gauge recorded 14.2 cfs on 2024-06-05 and 2024-06-15 [ep_005, ep_015], and 16.8 cfs on 2024-06-09 [ep_009].\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Conclusion**\\nThe monitoring period revealed two key environmental stressors:\\n1. **Localized Cr contamination at WQ-03**, likely linked to bridge construction, requiring source investigation.\\n2. **Agricultural runoff** impacting WQ-04/05, with elevated turbidity, nutrients, and algal indicators, suggesting need for riparian buffer assessment.\\n\\nAll other parameters remained within seasonal norms.
