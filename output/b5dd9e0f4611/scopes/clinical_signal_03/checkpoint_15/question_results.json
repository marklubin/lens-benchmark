Enrollment progressed steadily, reaching 180 by Week 8 [clinical_signal_03_ep_008], with final surge in Week 15 (+23 subjects). Site 07 emerged as the highest enroller (23 subjects), followed by Site 03 and Site 11 (20 each) [clinical_signal_03_ep_015]. All 12 sites maintained active enrollment, with **Site 01** showing the largest increase (from 4 to 22 enrolled). Statin concomitant use was consistently reported across sites, with **Site 07** having the highest count (7 subjects) [clinical_signal_03_ep_015]. Withdrawals increased from 0 to 7 cumulative, with a peak of 10 in Week 14 [clinical_signal_03_ep_014], suggesting a transient retention issue.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Lab Panel Trends: Hepatic Signal in Statin Subgroup**\\nA progressive elevation in **ALT and AST** was observed exclusively in the **statin subgroup**, beginning in Week 9 [clinical_signal_03_ep_009] and escalating through Week 15.\\n\\n- **Statin Subgroup ALT**:\\n  - Week 8 (2024-04-22): Mean 25.0 U/L [clinical_signal_03_ep_008]\\n  - Week 9: 32.3 \\u2192 Week 10: 37.2 \\u2192 Week 11: 47.6 \\u2192 Week 12: 47.2 \\u2192 Week 13: 52.4 \\u2192 Week 14: 57.6 \\u2192 **Week 15: 62.2 U/L** [clinical_signal_03_ep_015]\\n  - Median rose from 22.3 to **61.3 U/L**, indicating consistent upward shift across the cohort.\\n\\n- **AST** followed a parallel trend:\\n  - From 20.6 U/L (Week 8) to **51.0 U/L** (Week 15) [clinical_signal_03_ep_008] \\u2192 [clinical_signal_03_ep_015].\\n\\nDespite these increases, bilirubin and creatinine remained within normal ranges, suggesting **isolated transaminase elevation** rather than global hepatic or renal dysfunction. The **non-statin subgroup** showed stable or declining ALT (from 29.9 to 26.0 U/L), reinforcing the specificity of the signal to statin users.\\n\\nBy Week 14, the investigator noted ALT mean of **58 U/L** in the statin cohort, approaching but remaining below the 2x ULN action threshold [clinical_signal_03_ep_013]. In Week 15, **Site 07** triggered a lab investigation: its ALT analyzer was flagged for recalibration, and re-assays were ordered for 8 specimens due to suspected calibration drift [clinical_signal_03_ep_015]. This raises concern about potential **instrument bias contributing to the observed trend**, though the multi-site consistency of the signal suggests a true biological effect may also be present.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Adverse Events (AEs)**\\nA total of **54 AEs** were recorded, predominantly Grade 1 and resolved. The most frequent AE types were:\\n- **Upper respiratory infection / nasopharyngitis** (n=7, all non-statin or unrelated)\\n- **Nausea, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, insomnia** (mostly Grade 1, possibly or unlikely related)\\n\\nNotably, **transaminase elevation** emerged as a protocol-defined AE starting Week 10:\\n- AE-0032 (Week 10), AE-0035 (Week 11), AE-0039 (Week 12), AE-0043, AE-0044 (Week 13), AE-0048 (Week 14), AE-0053, AE-0054 (Week 15) \\u2014 all **possibly related** and in **statin subgroup** [clinical_signal_03_ep_010] \\u2192 [clinical_signal_03_ep_015].\\n\\nThis pattern confirms a **recurring, drug-related hepatic signal** in statin users, now manifesting as a distinct AE category.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Protocol Deviations**\\nA total of **31 protocol deviations** were recorded:\\n- **Minor (n=20)**: Mislabeled samples (PD-003, PD-012, PD-013, PD-016, PD-030), missed visits (PD-001, PD-027), outdated consent forms (PD-006, PD-009, PD-014, PD-021), fasting window violations (PD-010, PD-019, PD-023, PD-029), and missing concomitant med documentation (PD-008, PD-017, PD-020, PD-025).\\n- **Moderate (n=11)**: Dose modifications without PI approval (PD-005, PD-022, PD-026, PD-031), IP temperature excursions (PD-002, PD-004, PD-015, PD-018, PD-028).\\n\\n**Site 12** had the most moderate deviations (PD-015, PD-018), while **Site 05** and **Site 07** each had two dose modification issues (PD-005, PD-026). Temperature excursions occurred in shipments to **Sites 02, 11, 12, 08**, indicating potential cold chain vulnerabilities.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Operational & Investigator Notes**\\n- **Drug accountability** was consistently reconciled with no discrepancies [clinical_signal_03_ep_001, ep_005, ep_008, ep_015].\\n- **Query resolution rate** stabilized at 94% by Week 3 and maintained [clinical_signal_03_ep_003, ep_007].\\n- **EDC/IVRS systems** underwent routine updates with no impact on randomization [clinical_signal_03_ep_004, ep_005, ep_012].\\n- **Monitoring visits** at Sites 04, 06, 07, 09, 10, 12 yielded minor findings, all resolved.\\n- **Lab kit and drug supply** inventories remained adequate throughout.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Key Inferences & Anomalies**\\n1. **Hepatic Signal Specificity**: The ALT/AST rise is **exclusive to statin users**, with no parallel trend in non-statin group. This suggests a **drug-drug interaction** or **additive hepatotoxicity**.\\n2. **Instrument Artifact Risk**: Site 07\\u2019s analyzer issue [clinical_signal_03_ep_014, ep_015] necessitates re-evaluation of its data. Re-assay results will be critical to confirm or refute the magnitude of the signal.\\n3. **Dose Modification Risk**: Recurrent undocumented dose changes (Sites 05, 07, 10, 11) indicate a **systemic compliance gap** requiring targeted training.\\n4. **Enrollment Surge**: The final 23-subject increase in Week 15 may reflect site activation or relaxed screening, warranting review for consistency.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Conclusion**: The study is operationally stable with strong enrollment and data quality. However, a **consistent, possibly related hepatic signal in statin users** demands urgent review, particularly in light of Site 07\\u2019s calibration issue. Recommend: (1) central re-analysis of all statin-subgroup ALT/AST values, (2) expanded liver safety monitoring, and (3) root cause analysis of dose modification deviations.\", \"metadata\": {}}], \"count\": 1}",

Withdrawals increased from 0 to 7 cumulative, with a peak of 10 in Week 14 [clinical_signal_03_ep_014], suggesting a transient retention issue.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Lab Panel Trends: Hepatic Signal in Statin Subgroup**\\nA progressive elevation in **ALT and AST** was observed exclusively in the **statin subgroup**, beginning in Week 9 [clinical_signal_03_ep_009] and escalating through Week 15.\\n\\n- **Statin Subgroup ALT**:\\n  - Week 8 (2024-04-22): Mean 25.0 U/L [clinical_signal_03_ep_008]\\n  - Week 9: 32.3 \\u2192 Week 10: 37.2 \\u2192 Week 11: 47.6 \\u2192 Week 12: 47.2 \\u2192 Week 13: 52.4 \\u2192 Week 14: 57.6 \\u2192 **Week 15: 62.2 U/L** [clinical_signal_03_ep_015]\\n  - Median rose from 22.3 to **61.3 U/L**, indicating consistent upward shift across the cohort.\\n\\n- **AST** followed a parallel trend:\\n  - From 20.6 U/L (Week 8) to **51.0 U/L** (Week 15) [clinical_signal_03_ep_008] \\u2192 [clinical_signal_03_ep_015].\\n\\nDespite these increases, bilirubin and creatinine remained within normal ranges, suggesting **isolated transaminase elevation** rather than global hepatic or renal dysfunction. The **non-statin subgroup** showed stable or declining ALT (from 29.9 to 26.0 U/L), reinforcing the specificity of the signal to statin users.\\n\\nBy Week 14, the investigator noted ALT mean of **58 U/L** in the statin cohort, approaching but remaining below the 2x ULN action threshold [clinical_signal_03_ep_013]. In Week 15, **Site 07** triggered a lab investigation: its ALT analyzer was flagged for recalibration, and re-assays were ordered for 8 specimens due to suspected calibration drift [clinical_signal_03_ep_015]. This raises concern about potential **instrument bias contributing to the observed trend**, though the multi-site consistency of the signal suggests a true biological effect may also be present.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Adverse Events (AEs)**\\nA total of **54 AEs** were recorded, predominantly Grade 1 and resolved. The most frequent AE types were:\\n- **Upper respiratory infection / nasopharyngitis** (n=7, all non-statin or unrelated)\\n- **Nausea, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, insomnia** (mostly Grade 1, possibly or unlikely related)\\n\\nNotably, **transaminase elevation** emerged as a protocol-defined AE starting Week 10:\\n- AE-0032 (Week 10), AE-0035 (Week 11), AE-0039 (Week 12), AE-0043, AE-0044 (Week 13), AE-0048 (Week 14), AE-0053, AE-0054 (Week 15) \\u2014 all **possibly related** and in **statin subgroup** [clinical_signal_03_ep_010] \\u2192 [clinical_signal_03_ep_015].\\n\\nThis pattern confirms a **recurring, drug-related hepatic signal** in statin users, now manifesting as a distinct AE category.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Protocol Deviations**\\nA total of **31 protocol deviations** were recorded:\\n- **Minor (n=20)**: Mislabeled samples (PD-003, PD-012, PD-013, PD-016, PD-030), missed visits (PD-001, PD-027), outdated consent forms (PD-006, PD-009, PD-014, PD-021), fasting window violations (PD-010, PD-019, PD-023, PD-029), and missing concomitant med documentation (PD-008, PD-017, PD-020, PD-025).\\n- **Moderate (n=11)**: Dose modifications without PI approval (PD-005, PD-022, PD-026, PD-031), IP temperature excursions (PD-002, PD-004, PD-015, PD-018, PD-028).\\n\\n**Site 12** had the most moderate deviations (PD-015, PD-018), while **Site 05** and **Site 07** each had two dose modification issues (PD-005, PD-026). Temperature excursions occurred in shipments to **Sites 02, 11, 12, 08**, indicating potential cold chain vulnerabilities.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Operational & Investigator Notes**\\n- **Drug accountability** was consistently reconciled with no discrepancies [clinical_signal_03_ep_001, ep_005, ep_008, ep_015].\\n- **Query resolution rate** stabilized at 94% by Week 3 and maintained [clinical_signal_03_ep_003, ep_007].\\n- **EDC/IVRS systems** underwent routine updates with no impact on randomization [clinical_signal_03_ep_004, ep_005, ep_012].\\n- **Monitoring visits** at Sites 04, 06, 07, 09, 10, 12 yielded minor findings, all resolved.\\n- **Lab kit and drug supply** inventories remained adequate throughout.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Key Inferences & Anomalies**\\n1. **Hepatic Signal Specificity**: The ALT/AST rise is **exclusive to statin users**, with no parallel trend in non-statin group. This suggests a **drug-drug interaction** or **additive hepatotoxicity**.\\n2. **Instrument Artifact Risk**: Site 07\\u2019s analyzer issue [clinical_signal_03_ep_014, ep_015] necessitates re-evaluation of its data. Re-assay results will be critical to confirm or refute the magnitude of the signal.\\n3. **Dose Modification Risk**: Recurrent undocumented dose changes (Sites 05, 07, 10, 11) indicate a **systemic compliance gap** requiring targeted training.\\n4. **Enrollment Surge**: The final 23-subject increase in Week 15 may reflect site activation or relaxed screening, warranting review for consistency.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Conclusion**: The study is operationally stable with strong enrollment and data quality. However, a **consistent, possibly related hepatic signal in statin users** demands urgent review, particularly in light of Site 07\\u2019s calibration issue.

Enrollment progressed steadily, reaching 180 by Week 8 [clinical_signal_03_ep_008], with final surge in Week 15 (+23 subjects). Site 07 emerged as the highest enroller (23 subjects), followed by Site 03 and Site 11 (20 each) [clinical_signal_03_ep_015]. All 12 sites maintained active enrollment, with **Site 01** showing the largest increase (from 4 to 22 enrolled). Statin concomitant use was consistently reported across sites, with **Site 07** having the highest count (7 subjects) [clinical_signal_03_ep_015]. Withdrawals increased from 0 to 7 cumulative, with a peak of 10 in Week 14 [clinical_signal_03_ep_014], suggesting a transient retention issue.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Lab Panel Trends: Hepatic Signal in Statin Subgroup**\\nA progressive elevation in **ALT and AST** was observed exclusively in the **statin subgroup**, beginning in Week 9 [clinical_signal_03_ep_009] and escalating through Week 15.\\n\\n- **Statin Subgroup ALT**:\\n  - Week 8 (2024-04-22): Mean 25.0 U/L [clinical_signal_03_ep_008]\\n  - Week 9: 32.3 \\u2192 Week 10: 37.2 \\u2192 Week 11: 47.6 \\u2192 Week 12: 47.2 \\u2192 Week 13: 52.4 \\u2192 Week 14: 57.6 \\u2192 **Week 15: 62.2 U/L** [clinical_signal_03_ep_015]\\n  - Median rose from 22.3 to **61.3 U/L**, indicating consistent upward shift across the cohort.\\n\\n- **AST** followed a parallel trend:\\n  - From 20.6 U/L (Week 8) to **51.0 U/L** (Week 15) [clinical_signal_03_ep_008] \\u2192 [clinical_signal_03_ep_015].\\n\\nDespite these increases, bilirubin and creatinine remained within normal ranges, suggesting **isolated transaminase elevation** rather than global hepatic or renal dysfunction. The **non-statin subgroup** showed stable or declining ALT (from 29.9 to 26.0 U/L), reinforcing the specificity of the signal to statin users.\\n\\nBy Week 14, the investigator noted ALT mean of **58 U/L** in the statin cohort, approaching but remaining below the 2x ULN action threshold [clinical_signal_03_ep_013]. In Week 15, **Site 07** triggered a lab investigation: its ALT analyzer was flagged for recalibration, and re-assays were ordered for 8 specimens due to suspected calibration drift [clinical_signal_03_ep_015]. This raises concern about potential **instrument bias contributing to the observed trend**, though the multi-site consistency of the signal suggests a true biological effect may also be present.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Adverse Events (AEs)**\\nA total of **54 AEs** were recorded, predominantly Grade 1 and resolved. The most frequent AE types were:\\n- **Upper respiratory infection / nasopharyngitis** (n=7, all non-statin or unrelated)\\n- **Nausea, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, insomnia** (mostly Grade 1, possibly or unlikely related)\\n\\nNotably, **transaminase elevation** emerged as a protocol-defined AE starting Week 10:\\n- AE-0032 (Week 10), AE-0035 (Week 11), AE-0039 (Week 12), AE-0043, AE-0044 (Week 13), AE-0048 (Week 14), AE-0053, AE-0054 (Week 15) \\u2014 all **possibly related** and in **statin subgroup** [clinical_signal_03_ep_010] \\u2192 [clinical_signal_03_ep_015].\\n\\nThis pattern confirms a **recurring, drug-related hepatic signal** in statin users, now manifesting as a distinct AE category.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Protocol Deviations**\\nA total of **31 protocol deviations** were recorded:\\n- **Minor (n=20)**: Mislabeled samples (PD-003, PD-012, PD-013, PD-016, PD-030), missed visits (PD-001, PD-027), outdated consent forms (PD-006, PD-009, PD-014, PD-021), fasting window violations (PD-010, PD-019, PD-023, PD-029), and missing concomitant med documentation (PD-008, PD-017, PD-020, PD-025).\\n- **Moderate (n=11)**: Dose modifications without PI approval (PD-005, PD-022, PD-026, PD-031), IP temperature excursions (PD-002, PD-004, PD-015, PD-018, PD-028).\\n\\n**Site 12** had the most moderate deviations (PD-015, PD-018), while **Site 05** and **Site 07** each had two dose modification issues (PD-005, PD-026). Temperature excursions occurred in shipments to **Sites 02, 11, 12, 08**, indicating potential cold chain vulnerabilities.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Operational & Investigator Notes**\\n- **Drug accountability** was consistently reconciled with no discrepancies [clinical_signal_03_ep_001, ep_005, ep_008, ep_015].\\n- **Query resolution rate** stabilized at 94% by Week 3 and maintained [clinical_signal_03_ep_003, ep_007].\\n- **EDC/IVRS systems** underwent routine updates with no impact on randomization [clinical_signal_03_ep_004, ep_005, ep_012].\\n- **Monitoring visits** at Sites 04, 06, 07, 09, 10, 12 yielded minor findings, all resolved.\\n- **Lab kit and drug supply** inventories remained adequate throughout.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Key Inferences & Anomalies**\\n1. **Hepatic Signal Specificity**: The ALT/AST rise is **exclusive to statin users**, with no parallel trend in non-statin group. This suggests a **drug-drug interaction** or **additive hepatotoxicity**.\\n2. **Instrument Artifact Risk**: Site 07\\u2019s analyzer issue [clinical_signal_03_ep_014, ep_015] necessitates re-evaluation of its data. Re-assay results will be critical to confirm or refute the magnitude of the signal.\\n3. **Dose Modification Risk**: Recurrent undocumented dose changes (Sites 05, 07, 10, 11) indicate a **systemic compliance gap** requiring targeted training.\\n4. **Enrollment Surge**: The final 23-subject increase in Week 15 may reflect site activation or relaxed screening, warranting review for consistency.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Conclusion**: The study is operationally stable with strong enrollment and data quality. However, a **consistent, possibly related hepatic signal in statin users** demands urgent review, particularly in light of Site 07\\u2019s calibration issue. Recommend: (1) central re-analysis of all statin-subgroup ALT/AST values, (2) expanded liver safety monitoring, and (3) root cause analysis of dose modification deviations.\", \"metadata\": {}}], \"count\": 1}",

          "content": "Yes, there is sufficient evidence to convene a DSMB safety review. A consistent and progressive elevation in ALT and AST levels has been observed exclusively in the statin subgroup, with ALT rising from a mean of 25.0 U/L in Week 8 to 62.2 U/L in Week 15, and AST increasing from 20.6 U/L to 51.0 U/L over the same period [compaction_summary]. This signal is further supported by the emergence of transaminase elevation as a protocol-defined adverse event, with multiple cases reported starting in Week 10, all in the statin subgroup and assessed as possibly related [compaction_summary]. Although bilirubin and creatinine remain normal, indicating isolated transaminase elevation, the trend is concerning due to its consistency, specificity to statin users, and potential clinical significance as it approaches thresholds for hepatotoxicity [compaction_summary]. Additionally, while a lab analyzer issue at Site 07 raises questions about data accuracy, the multi-site nature of the signal suggests a true biological effect may be present [compaction_summary]. Given these findings, a DSMB review is warranted to assess the safety implications and determine if protocol modifications or enhanced monitoring are needed.",
