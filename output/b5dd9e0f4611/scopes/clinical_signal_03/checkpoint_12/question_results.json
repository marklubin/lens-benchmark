      "answer_text": "Yes, there is an emerging safety signal in the lab panels, specifically related to hepatic enzyme elevations in subjects concomitantly using statins.\n\nIn the statin subgroup (N \u2248 51\u201356), mean ALT increased by 85%, rising from 25.5 U/L at baseline to 47.2 U/L by 2024-05-20, with a sharp rise observed in the final four weeks [compaction_summary]. Mean AST also increased from 26.4 to 41.0 U/L over the same period, with a notable jump in the last two weeks [compaction_summary]. By 2024-05-13, mean ALT in this subgroup approached or exceeded 1.5\u00d7 the upper limit of normal (ULN), triggering protocol-level monitoring [compaction_summary].\n\nIn contrast, the non-statin subgroup (N \u2248 120\u2013132) showed stable or improving liver enzymes, with mean ALT decreasing from 29.9 to 22.0 U/L and mean AST from 26.4 to 23.5 U/L [compaction_summary]. Bilirubin, creatinine, and BUN remained stable in both groups, with no concerning renal trends [compaction_summary].\n\nTransaminase elevation was reported as an adverse event in three statin users (AE-0032, AE-0035, AE-0039), all occurring from 2024-05-06 onward, and no such events were reported in non-statin users [compaction_summary]. This pattern suggests a potential drug-statin interaction as a contributing factor to the observed hepatic signal.\n\nTherefore, the emerging safety signal involves progressive ALT and AST elevations exclusively in the statin-using subgroup, warranting further investigation [compaction_summary].",
