All laboratory values remain within typical reference ranges, and no clinically significant trends indicating organ toxicity or hematologic abnormalities are evident.\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n#### 1. **Liver Enzymes (ALT, AST, Bilirubin, ALP)**  \n- **Statin Subgroup**:  \n  - ALT and AST means fluctuate slightly but remain within normal limits (e.g., ALT mean: 25.5 [clinical_signal_03_ep_001] \u2192 26.8 [clinical_signal_03_ep_002] \u2192 26.0 [clinical_signal_03_ep_003] \u2192 24.6 [clinical_signal_03_ep_004]; AST mean: 26.4 \u2192 22.1 \u2192 27.9 \u2192 23.6).  \n  - No sustained elevation in transaminases is observed. Bilirubin remains below 1.0 mg/dL (highest mean: 0.86 [clinical_signal_03_ep_004]), and ALP is stable.  \n- **Non-Statin Subgroup**:  \n  - ALT mean decreases from 29.9 [clinical_signal_03_ep_001] to 24.6 [clinical_signal_03_ep_004], while AST remains stable (26.4 \u2192 24.7).  \n  - Bilirubin mean drops from 0.73 to 0.7, still within normal range.  \n\nThese fluctuations are minor and not indicative of hepatotoxicity. No subject-level thresholds (e.g., >3\u00d7 ULN) are reported, and no related hepatic AEs have been recorded.\n\n#### 2. **Renal Function (Creatinine, BUN)**  \n- Creatinine means remain stable in both subgroups:  \n  - Statin: ~1.06 mg/dL [clinical_signal_03_ep_001] \u2192 0.85 \u2192 1.04 \u2192 1.06 [clinical_signal_03_ep_004]  \n  - Non-statin: ~1.1 \u2192 0.92 \u2192 1.0 \u2192 1.01  \n- BUN shows a slight downward trend but remains within normal limits (means <20 mg/dL in all entries).  \n- No AEs related to renal dysfunction are reported.\n\n#### 3. **Hematology (WBC, Platelets)**  \n- WBC and platelet counts remain within normal ranges across all entries.  \n  - Statin WBC mean: 5.9 \u2192 7.5 \u2192 5.9 \u2192 8.2 [clinical_signal_03_ep_004] \u2014 transient increase in week 2, but median drops to 5.5 in week 4, suggesting no consistent trend.  \n  - Platelets remain stable (233\u2013245 mean in statin group; 218\u2013243 in non-statin).  \n- No hematologic AEs (e.g., infection, bleeding) reported.\n\n#### 4. **Adverse Events Correlation**  \n- All reported AEs are mild (Grade 1), resolved, and mostly unrelated or possibly related (e.g., nausea, headache, diarrhea).  \n- No severe or serious AEs (SAEs) are documented.  \n- No liver- or kidney-related AEs are reported (e.g., jaundice, elevated LFTs, renal failure).\n\n#### 5. **Protocol Deviations and Lab Errors**  \n- Minor deviations such as mislabeled samples [PD-003, clinical_signal_03_ep_001] or incorrect lab orders [PD-007, clinical_signal_03_ep_003] were corrected promptly and unlikely to impact overall data integrity or signal detection.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThere are **no emerging safety signals in the lab panels** based on the available data through [clinical_signal_03_ep_004]. All laboratory trends are within normal physiological ranges, with no consistent or clinically meaningful shifts over time in either subgroup. The investigator notes consistently state: \u201cLab panels within reference ranges. Routine AEs only.\u201d [clinical_signal_03_ep_001, clinical_signal_03_ep_002, clinical_signal_03_ep_003, clinical_signal_03_ep_004]. Therefore, no safety concerns are currently indicated.",

The highest mean values observed were:\n  - Statin subgroup: ALT mean = 26.8 U/L [clinical_signal_03_ep_002], AST mean = 27.9 U/L [clinical_signal_03_ep_003]\n  - Non-statin subgroup: ALT mean = 29.9 U/L [clinical_signal_03_ep_001], AST mean = 29.1 U/L [clinical_signal_03_ep_003]\n  \u2192 All values remain well below thresholds for concern (e.g., 3\u00d7 or 5\u00d7 upper limit of normal).\n\n- **Bilirubin**: Normal is typically \u22641.2 mg/dL. The highest mean was 0.9 mg/dL in the non-statin group [clinical_signal_03_ep_002], which is within normal range.\n\n- **Creatinine**: Normal is ~0.7\u20131.3 mg/dL. All reported means (e.g., 1.1 mg/dL max in non-statin group [clinical_signal_03_ep_001]) are within expected range.\n\n- **BUN**: Normal is ~7\u201320 mg/dL. All reported means fall within this range (e.g., max 16.9 mg/dL [clinical_signal_03_ep_001]).\n\n- **WBC and Platelets**: Hematologic parameters show no concerning trends. WBC medians fluctuate slightly but remain within normal (4\u201311 K/\u00b5L), and platelet counts are consistently above 200K, within normal limits.\n\nNotably, the **investigator notes and weekly summaries consistently state**:  \n> \"Lab panels within reference ranges.

Therefore, **no laboratory parameters are trending outside normal limits** in specific patient populations based on the available data.",

Examples include upper respiratory infection, nausea, headache, diarrhea, fatigue, and insomnia, all of which are described as mild and resolved [clinical_signal_03_ep_001, clinical_signal_03_ep_002, clinical_signal_03_ep_003, clinical_signal_03_ep_004].\n- Relatedness assessments indicate only \"possibly related,\" \"unlikely related,\" or \"not related\" determinations, with no events deemed \"definitely related\" or showing a concerning pattern of drug-related toxicity.\n- Lab panels for both statin and non-statin subgroups remain within normal reference ranges across all timepoints, with no consistent or clinically significant trends in ALT, AST, bilirubin, creatinine, or other key safety markers.

There are **no new safety signals** identified by local principal investigators as of [clinical_signal_03_ep_004].\n\n### Adverse Events Overview:\nAll reported AEs are Grade 1 and resolved:\n- **Statin subgroup**: \n  - upper respiratory infection [clinical_signal_03_ep_001]\n  - headache [clinical_signal_03_ep_001]\n  - diarrhea (reported twice: [clinical_signal_03_ep_001], [clinical_signal_03_ep_002])\n  - nausea [clinical_signal_03_ep_002]\n  - fatigue [clinical_signal_03_ep_003]\n- **Non-statin subgroup**:\n  - nausea [clinical_signal_03_ep_001]\n  - nasopharyngitis [clinical_signal_03_ep_002]\n  - diarrhea [clinical_signal_03_ep_002]\n  - fatigue (twice) [clinical_signal_03_ep_003]\n  - headache [clinical_signal_03_ep_003]\n  - insomnia [clinical_signal_03_ep_004]\n  - nasopharyngitis [clinical_signal_03_ep_004]\n\nMost AEs are assessed as **possibly or unlikely related** to the study drug, and none are ongoing or severe.\n\n### Lab Safety Parameters:\nLiver enzymes (ALT, AST), renal function (creatinine, BUN), and hematologic markers (WBC, platelets) remain **within normal reference ranges** across all weekly summaries, with no concerning trends:\n- In [clinical_signal_03_ep_001], baseline liver enzymes are slightly higher in the non-statin group (ALT mean 29.9 vs. 25.5 in statin), but this difference **narrows over time**.\n- By [clinical_signal_03_ep_004], ALT mean is **equal (24.6 U/L)** in both subgroups, suggesting stabilization.\n- AST shows fluctuation but remains within normal limits; no subject-level elevations are flagged.\n- Bilirubin, ALP, and renal markers show minor variability but no consistent worsening.\n\nNotably, the **statin subgroup** has a **higher number of subjects on statins (52\u201353)** despite enrollment growth, and **no disproportionate increase in hepatotoxicity** is observed, which is relevant given statins\u2019 known liver enzyme effects.\n\n### Protocol Deviations:\nDeviations are primarily **minor** (e.g., missed visit window, labeling errors, outdated consent forms) and **not safety-related**. Two moderate deviations involve **IP temperature excursions** ([PD-002], [PD-004]) and **dose modification without approval** ([PD-005]), but no impact on safety outcomes is reported.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Emerging safety profile**: LNS-4821 is well-tolerated, with only mild, transient AEs and stable laboratory parameters over 4 weeks of enrollment up to 100 randomized subjects.\n- **Most affected subgroup**: The **statin subgroup** reports a **slightly higher number of AEs possibly related to the drug** (e.g., diarrhea, nausea, headache), but these are not more severe or frequent over time. However, given that the statin subgroup has more subjects on concomitant statins (a potential confounder), and no worsening of liver enzymes is observed, there is **no evidence of increased risk** in this group.\n\nThus, **no patient subgroup shows a concerning safety signal**, but the **statin subgroup has the majority of possibly related AEs**, warranting continued monitoring.
