The repeated **DISK-USAGE-WARN** alerts on 2024-01-16 and 2024-01-18 suggest the current retention policy is insufficient to prevent pressure [ref_id: compaction_summary].\n\n3. **Infrastructure Scaling in Proportion to Load**: Gateways and services like `service-b-01` show CPU and connection increases (e.g., gateway-01 CPU from 34% to 37%, connections +8%) that align with rising traffic, indicating stable resource utilization [ref_id: compaction_summary].\n\n4. **Healthy Connection Pools**: No exhaustion or waiting observed in any connection pool (primary, replica, third_party_geo), with active connections increasing moderately and well within capacity [ref_id: compaction_summary].\n\n5. **CDN Efficiency**: CDN hit rate improved slightly (94.1% \u2192 94.4%) while origin traffic increased by 11.3%, confirming effective caching under growing load [ref_id: compaction_summary].\n\n6. **Low-Severity Operational Alerts**: \n   - A **TLS-HANDSHAKE-ERRORS** alert occurred on gateway-01 (42 errors on 2024-01-19), but with no performance impact [ref_id: compaction_summary].\n   - A **NODE-CLOCK-SKEW** alert (180ms on gateway-02) was resolved via NTP sync on 2024-01-18 [ref_id: compaction_summary].\n   - Certificate expiry warnings (30D, then 14D) are on track for renewal [ref_id: compaction_summary].\n\n7. **No Impact from Deployments**: All service deployments (auth, product-catalog, search, recommendations) showed no correlated performance issues, with latency and error rates remaining within expected trends [ref_id: compaction_summary].\n\nIn summary, the system is operating within healthy parameters, but the recurring disk usage issue on `metrics-db-01` warrants proactive attention to prevent future capacity risks [ref_id: compaction_summary].",

All endpoints maintained >99.87% success rates, and infrastructure metrics showed consistent, predictable behavior. Key trends include gradual increases in request volume, stable latency profiles, and persistent disk pressure on `metrics-db-01`. No cascading failure occurred during this window, but disk usage and configuration changes warrant monitoring.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **ENDPOINT PERFORMANCE TRENDS**\\nAll endpoints showed consistent performance with minor, linear increases in latency and request volume.\\n\\n- **/checkout**:  \\n  - Requests increased from 118,240 to 126,450 (+7.0%) [ep_001 \\u2192 ep_005].  \\n  - p99 latency rose from 320ms to 336ms (+5.0%), tracking with load.  \\n  - Error rate stable at 0.12\\u20130.13% (142 \\u2192 165 errors), no spike observed.  \\n  - Success rate consistently 99.87\\u201399.88%.\\n\\n- **/fraud_check**, **/geo_lookup**, **/auth**, **/product_catalog**, **/search**, **/recommendations**:  \\n  - All showed proportional increases in request volume (6\\u20138% growth).  \\n  - p50/p95/p99 latencies increased linearly, within 5\\u201310% of baseline.  \\n  - Error counts rose slightly due to volume, but rates held steady:  \\n    - /search error rate increased from 0.09% to 0.1% [ep_001 \\u2192 ep_005].  \\n    - /recommendations error count rose from 146 to 160, rate unchanged at 0.1%.  \\n  - No evidence of service degradation or regression.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **INFRASTRUCTURE UTILIZATION**\\nSteady growth in load across all systems.\\n\\n- **Gateways (gateway-01, gateway-02)**:  \\n  - CPU: gateway-01 increased from 34% to 37%, gateway-02 from 32% to 35% [ep_001 \\u2192 ep_005].  \\n  - Conns: gateway-01 from 1,820 to 1,965 (+8.0%); gateway-02 from 1,755 to 1,878 (+7.0%).  \\n  - Network: Net out increased from ~420 Mbps to ~460 Mbps (gateway-01).  \\n  - Disk and memory stable: gateway-01 disk 61%, mem 58% \\u2192 60%.\\n\\n- **service-b-01**:  \\n  - CPU from 29% to 32%, conns from 980 to 1,065 (+8.7%) \\u2014 proportional to load.\\n\\n- **metrics-db-01**:  \\n  - **Disk usage fluctuated but remained high**: 78% \\u2192 82% \\u2192 79% \\u2192 80% \\u2192 79% [ep_001 to ep_005].  \\n  - Peaked at 82% on 2024-01-16, post-cleanup [ep_002], indicating insufficient relief from retention policy.  \\n  - CPU and memory stable (22\\u201325%, 65\\u201367%).  \\n  - Conns increased from 220 to 240 (+9.1%), consistent with data ingestion growth.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **CONNECTION POOLS**\\nNo signs of exhaustion or contention.\\n\\n- **primary pool**: Active connections rose from 68 to 78 (+14.7%), idle decreased from 132 to 122.  \\n  - Max 200, no waiting, avg_wait 2ms throughout \\u2014 healthy utilization.  \\n- **replica pool**: Active from 34 to 38, idle 66 \\u2192 62.  \\n- **third_party_geo**: Active from 22 to 26, idle 38 \\u2192 34.  \\n- **No waiting or exhaustion** in any pool across episodes \\u2014 capacity sufficient.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **CDN & CACHING**\\nEfficient offload from origin.\\n\\n- **Hit rate**: 94.1% \\u2192 94.4% [ep_001 \\u2192 ep_005], minor improvement.  \\n- **Bandwidth**: Origin traffic increased from 6.2 Gbps to 6.9 Gbps (+11.3%).  \\n- **Origin requests**: 312,400 \\u2192 339,100 (+8.5%), tracking with user load.  \\n- Events:  \\n  - CDN origin shield enabled for `/static` on 2024-01-16 [ep_002].  \\n  - Cache purge for `/assets/logo.svg` on 2024-01-18 [ep_004] \\u2014 no impact observed.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **ALERTS & INCIDENTS**\\nLow-severity alerts only; no cascading triggers.\\n\\n- **DISK-USAGE-WARN on metrics-db-01**:  \\n  - Repeated [WARNING] on 2024-01-16 (82%) [ep_002] and 2024-01-18 (80%) [ep_004].  \\n  - Despite cleanup on 2024-01-16 [ep_002], disk usage remains >79%, suggesting retention policy insufficient.  \\n  - No action taken in subsequent days.\\n\\n- **TLS-HANDSHAKE-ERRORS on gateway-01**:  \\n  - 42 errors reported on 2024-01-19 [ep_005].

Despite a cleanup operation on 2024-01-16, which temporarily reduced usage from 82% to 79%, the disk usage rebounded, indicating that the current retention policy is insufficient to manage long-term growth [compaction_summary]. This is further supported by repeated [WARNING] alerts for DISK-USAGE-WARN on 2024-01-16 (82%) and 2024-01-18 (80%) [compaction_summary].\n\n2. **Emerging TLS Handshake Errors on `gateway-01`**:  \n   On 2024-01-19, 42 TLS handshake errors were reported on `gateway-01`, marking the first occurrence of such alerts in the observed period [compaction_summary].
