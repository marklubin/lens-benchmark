This suggests either:\n- Inadequate cleanup efficacy,\n- Growing data ingestion outpacing retention policies, or\n- A configuration issue with retention (noted in [cascading_failure_01_ep_008], retention was adjusted to 21d for high-cardinality series, which may increase pressure).\n\n> **Concern**: If disk usage trends upward during peak days (e.g., 2024-01-20 had higher traffic), there is risk of exhaustion during high-load periods.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Gradual Increase in Request Volume and System Load**\nSeveral endpoints show **steady growth in request volume**, particularly over the weekend:\n\n- `/checkout` requests increase from **118,240 (2024-01-15)** to **131,200 (2024-01-20)** [cascading_failure_01_ep_001] \u2192 [cascading_failure_01_ep_006], a **~11% increase**.\n- Corresponding increases in gateway connection counts: `gateway-01` conns rise from **1820 to 2055** over the same period.\n- Network throughput on gateways increases from **420 Mbps to 488 Mbps (ingress)**.\n\nWhile performance metrics (p50, p95, p99) remain stable and error rates are low and consistent (e.g., `/checkout` errors stay at **0.12\u20130.13%**), the **system is under increasing load** without proportional scaling observed (autoscaling min unchanged [cascading_failure_01_ep_003]).\n\n> **Concern**: The infrastructure is handling the load, but with diminishing headroom. Combined with disk pressure, this reduces resilience to spikes.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Repetitive Warnings and Operational Churn**\n- **TLS handshake errors** appear on 2024-01-19 on `gateway-01` ([INFO] TLS-HANDSHAKE-ERRORS: count=42) [cascading_failure_01_ep_005], which may indicate client compatibility or clock issues.\n- **Node clock skew** detected on `gateway-02` (180ms) on 2024-01-18 [cascading_failure_01_ep_004], prompting an NTP sync. Clock skew can affect TLS and distributed tracing.\n- **Pod restarts** on `service-b-01` (2 restarts) on 2024-01-21 [cascading_failure_01_ep_007], though no performance impact is visible.\n\nThese are minor individually but suggest **increasing operational noise**.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **",

However, there are **underlying infrastructure concerns** that could potentially affect reliability if left unaddressed.\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n1. **Stable Endpoint Performance**:\n   - All endpoints maintain consistent p50, p95, and p99 latencies over time. For example, `/checkout` p99 latency fluctuates between 318ms and 340ms but remains within a narrow band [cascading_failure_01_ep_003] to [cascading_failure_01_ep_006], with a slight decrease on 2024-01-22 [cascading_failure_01_ep_008].\n   - Error rates remain stable: `/checkout` error rate holds at 0.12\u20130.13% [cascading_failure_01_ep_001] through [cascading_failure_01_ep_008], indicating no increase in user-facing failures.\n\n2. **No Service Outages or Cascading Failures Observed**:\n   - Despite the log series title suggesting a \"cascading failure,\" no actual cascading failure is evident in the data. All services continue operating within normal parameters.\n   - Connection pools show **no exhaustion** (waiting=0, avg_wait \u22643ms) across all entries [e.g., cascading_failure_01_ep_001], ruling out database connection bottlenecks.\n\n3. **Primary Concern: Disk Usage on metrics-db-01**:\n   - The most persistent issue is **disk usage on metrics-db-01**, which triggers repeated `[WARNING] DISK-USAGE-WARN` alerts:\n     - 78% on 2024-01-15 [cascading_failure_01_ep_001]\n     - 82% peak on 2024-01-16 [cascading_failure_01_ep_002]\n     - Fluctuates between 79\u201380% thereafter [cascading_failure_01_ep_003] to [cascading_failure_01_ep_007]\n     - Drops to 78% on 2024-01-22 [cascading_failure_01_ep_008]\n   - This correlates with tickets like DISK-4421, DISK-4450, and DISK-4512 [cascading_failure_01_ep_001], [cascading_failure_01_ep_002], [cascading_failure_01_ep_006], indicating ongoing operational focus on cleanup.\n\n4. **Mitigation Actions Taken**:\n   - A **metrics-db cleanup** was executed on 2024-01-16 [cascading_failure_01_ep_002], which reduced disk usage from 82% to 79% by 2024-01-17 [cascading_failure_01_ep_003].\n   - On 2024-01-22, a **metrics retention policy was adjusted** to 21 days for high-cardinality series [cascading_failure_01_ep_008], likely to control growth.\n\n5. **Other Minor Events**:\n   - A pod restart occurred on `service-b-01` (2 restarts) on 2024-01-21 [cascading_failure_01_ep_007], but no performance impact is visible in dependent services.\n   - TLS handshake errors (42 events) were logged on gateway-01 on 2024-01-19 [cascading_failure_01_ep_005], but no corresponding spike in `/auth` errors or latency.\n   - Clock skew (180ms) detected on gateway-02 on 2024-01-18 [cascading_failure_01_ep_004], followed by NTP sync\u2014no service impact observed.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- **User-facing impact**: **Negligible**. All endpoints maintain high success rates, stable latency, and no outage reports. CDN hit rate remains strong (~94%), and origin traffic scales linearly with request volume.\n- **Driving factor**: The primary operational concern is **growing disk utilization on metrics-db-01",

The volume increases gradually, peaks on 2024-01-20, then declines. The highest daily volume is **131,200** ([cascading_failure_01_ep_006]), only **~11% higher** than the lowest (118,240), and growth is linear, not spike-like.\n\n- **Error Rate Trend:**\n  - Error count increases from **142** ([cascading_failure_01_ep_001]) to **170** ([cascading_failure_01_ep_006]), but **error percentage remains stable at 0.13%** (except one day at 0.12%).\n  - This indicates **errors are scaling proportionally with traffic**, not disproportionately as would be expected during overload.\n\n- **Latency Trend:**\n  - p99 latency increases from **320ms** ([cascading_failure_01_ep_001]) to **340ms** ([cascading_failure_01_ep_006]), a **6.25% increase** over 6 days.\n  - This is a **gradual rise**, not a sudden jump, suggesting no acute performance degradation.\n\n- **Infrastructure Indicators:**\n  - Gateway CPU increases from **34% \u2192 39%** ([cascading_failure_01_ep_001] to [cascading_failure_01_ep_006]) \u2014 gradual, not alarming.\n  - Connection pools show **no waiting or exhaustion** in any entry (e.g., `primary` pool: `waiting 0`, `exhaustion: 0` in all entries).\n  - Network and connection counts rise proportionally with traffic, but **no saturation observed**.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n\u274c **The data does NOT match the pattern expected from a traffic spike causing checkout failures.**\n\n- Traffic increases **gradually**, not as a spike.\n- Errors and latencies scale **linearly**, not exponentially.\n- No infrastructure saturation or connection pool exhaustion is observed.\n\nTherefore, **checkout failures are unlikely caused by a traffic spike**. The pattern suggests **stable system behavior under gradually increasing load**, and any failure root cause is more likely due to **configuration changes, downstream dependencies, or code defects** \u2014 not volume overload.",
