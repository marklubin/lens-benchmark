The fact that it increased post-cleanup suggests either:\n   - The cleanup was insufficient,\n   - Data ingestion rates have increased, or\n   - Retention policies are not properly enforced.\n\n2. **No Connection Pool Exhaustion or Latency Spikes:**\n   - All connection pools (`primary`, `replica`, `third_party_geo`) show **0 waiting**, **0 exhaustion**, and stable `avg_wait` times across all days [e.g., cascading_failure_01_ep_001 to cascading_failure_01_ep_004].\n   - Endpoint latencies (p50, p95, p99) and error rates remain **stable** with no upward trends. For example:\n     - `/checkout` error rate fluctuates between **0.12%\u20130.13%** [cascading_failure_01_ep_001 to cascading_failure_01_ep_004], within normal variance.\n     - Latency metrics show minor fluctuations but no sustained increase.\n\n3. **Infrastructure Resource Utilization is Stable:**\n   - CPU, memory, and network usage across `gateway-01`, `gateway-02`, and `service-b-01` remain within normal ranges and show no signs of saturation.\n   - Minor clock skew (180ms) detected on `gateway-02` on 2024-01-18 [cascading_failure_01_ep_004] was addressed via NTP sync, and is not currently a systemic issue.\n\n4. **CDN and Caching Performance is Consistent:**\n   - Hit rate remains steady around **94%**, with origin requests scaling proportionally with traffic [e.g., 312400 \u2192 328700] [cascading_failure_01_ep_001 to cascading_failure_01_ep_004].\n   - Bandwidth increases slightly, but this correlates with higher request volume, not inefficiency.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nWhile **overall service health appears stable**\u2014with no outages, rising error rates, or latency spikes\u2014the **recurring disk usage warnings on `metrics-db-01`** represent a **clear and persistent risk**. The disk usage remains above 78% and has exceeded 80% twice in four days, despite a cleanup operation. This could lead to a future outage if not addressed.\n\n> **Recommendation**: Investigate why disk usage remains high post-cleanup and evaluate log retention, data compaction, or storage scaling for `metrics-db-01`.",

The scheduled cleanup on 2024-01-16 did **not prevent** disk usage from increasing beyond the previous day\u2019s level.\n2. Despite daily fluctuations, disk usage remains **consistently above 78%**, trending upward overall.\n3. The system is not effectively reducing disk pressure long-term, suggesting the cleanup may be insufficient, misconfigured, or failing to address the root data retention or ingestion issue.\n\nAdditionally, while other metrics (endpoint latencies, error rates, connection pools) remain stable and within normal variance, the persistent and recurring disk warnings on a critical database node represent an **emerging infrastructure risk**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThere is sufficient evidence to initiate investigation into **why the metrics-db cleanup is not adequately controlling disk growth** on `metrics-db-01`. This includes reviewing:\n- Data retention policies,\n- Volume of incoming metrics,\n- Effectiveness of the cleanup job,\n- Potential schema or indexing bloat.\n\nThis trend, while not yet causing service degradation, poses a risk of future resource exhaustion and potential cascading failures if unaddressed.",
    "cf01_q11_longitudinal:Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507-tput:cap2048": "The current impact on user-facing services is **minimal to negligible**, as all endpoints continue to show high success rates (>99.87%), stable latency, and no connection pool exhaustion across the observed period from 2024-01-15 to 2024-01-18 [cascading_failure_01_ep_001 to cascading_failure_01_ep_004].\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Endpoint Error Rates**: All services maintain consistent error rates. For example, `/checkout` error rate fluctuates between 0.12% and 0.13% [cascading_failure_01_ep_001, cascading_failure_01_ep_002, cascading_failure_01_ep_004], translating to approximately 140\u2013150 errors per ~120,000 requests \u2014 a very low impact.\n- **Latency Stability**: p50, p95, and p99 latencies remain within expected ranges across all endpoints. For instance, `/checkout` p99 latency varies between 318ms and 330ms \u2014 stable with no degradation trend [cascading_failure_01_ep_001 to cascading_failure_01_ep_004].\n- **Infrastructure Health**: Gateways and services show moderate CPU and memory usage with no signs of saturation. Connection pools report **zero waiting or exhaustion** [e.g., cascading_failure_01_ep_004: primary pool waiting=0, exhaustion=0], indicating no resource contention.\n- **CDN Performance**: Hit rate remains high (~94%), and origin requests scale proportionally with traffic, suggesting caching remains effective [cascading_failure_01_ep_004: hit rate=94.2%, origin requests=328700].\n\n### What Appears to Be Driving Concerns:\nThe primary recurring issue is **disk usage on `metrics-db-01`**, which triggered warnings:\n- Disk usage rose from 78% [cascading_failure_01_ep_001] to 82% on 2024-01-16 [cascading_failure_01_ep_002], dropped to 79% on 2024-01-17 [cascading_failure_01_ep_003], and stabilized at 80% on 2024-01-18 [cascading_failure_01_ep_004].\n- This was flagged with `[WARNING] DISK-USAGE-WARN` on three consecutive days [cascading_failure_01_ep_002, cascading_failure_01_ep_003, cascading_failure_01_ep_004], and associated with tickets (DISK-4421, DISK-4450).\n- Despite the cleanup job running on 2024-01-16 [cascading_failure_01_ep_002: \"metrics-db cleanup ran 2024-01-16 02:00Z\"], disk usage remains high, suggesting either insufficient cleanup or growing data ingestion.\n\nAdditionally, a minor clock skew of 180ms was detected on `gateway-02` on 2024-01-18, triggering an info alert and an NTP sync [cascading_failure_01_ep_004], but this is unlikely to affect user services significantly.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThere is **no observable degradation in user-facing services**. The system remains stable in terms of performance, availability, and scalability. The main underlying driver of operational concern is **persistent high disk utilization on `metrics-db-01`**, which is infrastructure-related and not currently impacting end-user experience.",

This indicates the **cleanup may not be sufficient or retention policies are too aggressive**.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Recommended Preventive Actions:\n\n1. **Investigate and Optimize Metrics Retention Policy**  \n   - Review what data is being retained and for how long.  \n   - Consider down-sampling older metrics or moving cold data to cheaper, scalable storage.  \n   - Cite: On-call tickets DISK-4421 and DISK-4450 ([cascading_failure_01_ep_001], [cascading_failure_01_ep_002]) indicate this is a known and recurring issue.\n\n2. **Increase Monitoring Thresholds and Add Forecasting**  \n   - Add predictive alerts (e.g., \u201cdisk will fill in 7 days\u201d) using trend analysis.  \n   - Currently, only static threshold warnings are in place, which may not provide enough lead time.\n\n3. **Automate Cleanup or Scale Storage Proactively**  \n   - If cleanup is manual or insufficient, automate more aggressive pruning based on age or cardinality.  \n   - Alternatively, schedule a storage upgrade before capacity becomes critical.\n\n4. **Verify Effectiveness of Scheduled Cleanup**  \n   - The cleanup ran on 2024-01-16 ([cascading_failure_01_ep_002]) but did not prevent rapid re-accumulation.  \n   - Audit the cleanup script: Is it deleting the right data? Is log/metric ingestion rate increasing?\n\n5. **Evaluate Need for Horizontal Scaling or Alternative Storage**  \n   - If metrics volume is growing steadily (origin requests increased from 312,400 to 328,700 over 4 days), consider sharding or switching to a time-series-optimized DB with better compression and retention controls.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nWhile no cascading failure has occurred in these logs, the **repeated disk usage warnings on `metrics-db-01` represent a latent risk** that could trigger outages if unaddressed. The team should:\n\n> **Prioritize optimizing the metrics retention and cleanup strategy, validate the effectiveness of existing automation, and plan for storage scalability to prevent future resource exhaustion.**\n\nCite: [cascading_failure_01_ep_001], [cascading_failure_01_ep_002], [cascading_failure_01_ep_003], [cascading_failure_01_ep_004] \u2013 all show persistent high disk usage despite cleanup."
