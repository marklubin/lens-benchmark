The fact that it increased post-cleanup suggests either:\n   - The cleanup was insufficient,\n   - Data ingestion rates have increased, or\n   - Retention policies are not properly enforced.\n\n2. **No Impact on Endpoint Performance Despite Disk Warnings:**\n   - All endpoints maintain **stable latency (p50, p95, p99)** and **low error rates (<0.13%)** across all four days.\n   - For example, `/checkout`, the most critical path, shows consistent performance:  \n     - p99 latency fluctuates between **318ms and 330ms** [cascading_failure_01_ep_001\u2013004]  \n     - Error rate remains at **~0.12\u20130.13%**  \n   - Connection pools show **no exhaustion** (waiting=0, avg_wait stable) [all entries]\n\n3. **Infrastructure Metrics Are Otherwise Stable:**\n   - CPU, memory, and network usage on gateways and services show **normal daily variation** with no spikes or sustained pressure.\n   - Autoscaling remains unchanged, indicating no scaling events triggered by load [cascading_failure_01_ep_003]\n\n4. **Operational Activity Is Routine:**\n   - Regular deployments (e.g., product-catalog v5.8.0 [cascading_failure_01_ep_002], recommendations v1.9.0 [cascading_failure_01_ep_004]) show no correlated performance impact.\n   - On-call shifts report **zero pages** and minimal tickets, indicating no user-facing incidents.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nWhile **overall service health remains stable**, the **repeated disk usage warnings on `metrics-db-01`** represent a **concerning operational pattern**. The disk usage:\n- Has exceeded 78% for **3 out of 4 days**,\n- Peaked at **82%** [cascading_failure_01_ep_002],\n- And shows **no clear downward trend** despite cleanup efforts.\n\nIf this trend continues, it risks **disk exhaustion**, which could lead to **metrics loss, failed writes, or service disruption** if the database is part of a critical path (e.g., authentication or billing).

For example:\n     - `/checkout` p99 latency fluctuates between 318ms ([cascading_failure_01_ep_003]) and 330ms ([cascading_failure_01_ep_002]), within a consistent range.\n     - Error rates are stable: `/checkout` error rate remains at 0.12\u20130.13%, with no upward trend.\n   - No endpoint shows increasing error rates, latency spikes, or request drops.\n\n2. **Infrastructure Health**:  \n   - CPU, memory, and connection metrics for all nodes (e.g., `gateway-01`, `service-b-01`) remain within normal operational ranges and show no signs of resource exhaustion.\n   - Network throughput and connection counts scale proportionally with request volume, indicating healthy load handling.\n\n3. **Connection Pools**:  \n   - No pool exhaustion is reported.

While there is a recurring **[WARNING] DISK-USAGE-WARN on metrics-db-01**, this system is not directly involved in processing /checkout transactions based on the data provided. The connection pools show **no exhaustion or waiting requests** [all entries], and gateway and service resource usage remains stable.\n\n- No deployments directly affecting the `/checkout` service are reported during this period. The A/B test 'checkout-v2' has been at a steady 15% rollout since at least 2024-01-15 [cascading_failure_01_ep_001], with no changes noted, suggesting it is not introducing instability.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe `/checkout` endpoint is **not failing at an abnormal rate**. The small number of errors (around 0.12%) is consistent over time and likely represents transient or client-side issues (e.g., timeouts, invalid input, or network glitches), not a systemic failure.
