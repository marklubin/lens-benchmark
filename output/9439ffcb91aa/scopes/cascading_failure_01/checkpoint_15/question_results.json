While baseline operations from [ep_001] to [ep_013] show stable, predictable behavior with minor fluctuations, a clear inflection point occurs around **2024-01-28 ([ep_014])**, marking the onset of systemic instability. This synthesis identifies three distinct phases\\u2014**Stable Baseline**, **Performance Creep**, and **Cascading Failure**\\u2014and analyzes the correlations and causal drivers behind the transitions.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Phase 1: Stable Baseline (ep_001 to ep_013)\\n\\nFrom [ep_001] to [ep_013] (2024-01-15 to 2024-01-27), the system operates within expected parameters:\\n\\n- **Endpoint latencies** are consistent and low. For example, `/checkout` p99 latency remains stable at ~320\\u2013450ms [ep_001]\\u2013[ep_013], with error rates below 0.16%.\\n- **Infrastructure metrics** show gradual but linear growth in load:\\n  - Gateway connections increase from 1,755 (gateway-02, [ep_001]) to 2,285 ([ep_013]), tracking with rising request volumes.\\n  - CPU usage on gateways rises from 32% to 41% ([ep_013]), and service-b-01 CPU climbs from 29% to 46%.\\n- **Correlation**: Request volume increases (~5\\u20137% week-over-week) correlate with proportional increases in infrastructure load, but **no signs of saturation or nonlinear behavior**.\\n\\nNotably, **latency creep begins subtly in [ep_009] (2024-01-23)**:\\n- `/geo_lookup` p50 jumps from 55ms ([ep_008]) to **75ms** ([ep_009]), with p99 rising to 250ms.\\n- `/fraud_check` and `/checkout` also show latency increases: `/fraud_check` p99 rises from 248ms ([ep_008]) to **290ms** ([ep_009]).\\n- Error rates remain low, but this marks the **first deviation from baseline stability**.\\n\\nThis suggests an **underlying stressor introduced or amplified around [ep_009]**, possibly related to a configuration change, traffic pattern shift, or dependency degradation\\u2014though no explicit alert or configuration log is provided.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Phase 2: Performance Creep and Compounding Stress (ep_009 to ep_013)\\n\\nFrom [ep_009] to [ep_013], a **steady deterioration** in latency and efficiency becomes evident, particularly in downstream services:\\n\\n- **/geo_lookup** degrades significantly:\\n  -

This degradation continues progressively through [ep_013], with `/geo_lookup` p50 reaching 98ms and p99 hitting 330ms, alongside rising CPU usage on service-b-01 (from 31% to 46%) and increasing error rates [ref_id: synthesis].\n\nThe fact that gateways and auth services remain stable while service-b-01 shows disproportionate resource consumption strongly suggests a localized bottleneck in service-b-01 or its dependencies [ref_id: synthesis]. The consistent correlation between the onset of latency creep and increasing load on service-b-01 indicates a likely root cause tied to this component, warranting immediate investigation into its configuration, code changes, or downstream dependencies introduced around [ep_009].",
