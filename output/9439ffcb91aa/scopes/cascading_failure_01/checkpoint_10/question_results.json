The most significant changes occurred between **[ep_008]** (2024-01-22) and **[ep_010]** (2024-01-24), marking a clear transition from baseline stability to emerging performance stress. This shift was not driven by infrastructure saturation but likely by internal service dependencies or configuration changes, particularly affecting downstream services like `/geo_lookup` and `/fraud_check`.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **Baseline Stability (ep_001 to ep_008): January 15\\u201322**\\n\\nFrom **[ep_001]** to **[ep_008]**, the system operated within consistent performance parameters:\\n- Latency metrics (p50, p95, p99) for all endpoints showed only minor fluctuations.\\n- Error rates remained stable: `/checkout` errors hovered at 0.12\\u20130.13%, `/fraud_check` at 0.08%, and `/geo_lookup` at 0.05%.\\n- Infrastructure metrics (CPU, memory, network) increased slightly with traffic volume but stayed well within capacity (e.g., gateway-01 CPU peaked at 39% in [ep_006], still under 40%).\\n\\nTraffic volume grew steadily (~5\\u20137% week-over-week), yet the system absorbed it efficiently. For example:\\n- `/product_catalog` requests increased from 204,800 [ep_001] to 229,700 [ep_006], with p99 latency only rising from 140ms to 150ms.\\n- `/checkout` p99 latency remained under 340ms until [ep_006], indicating healthy scaling.\\n\\nThis period reflects a **stable operational state** with predictable performance scaling.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **Turning Point: [ep_009] (January 23)**\\n\\nThe first signs of **abnormal degradation** appear in **[ep_009]**:\\n- `/geo_lookup` p50 latency jumps from 55ms to **75ms**, p95 from 132ms to **190ms**, and p99 from 182ms to **250ms** \\u2014 a **~45% increase in p95**.\\n- `/fraud_check` p50 increases from 68ms to **72ms**, p95 from 163ms to **182ms**, and p99 from 248ms to **290ms**.\\n- Error rates rise: `/geo_lookup` errors increase from 0.05% to **0.06%**, and `/fraud_check` from 0.08% to **0.09%**.\\n- `/checkout` p99 latency increases to **370ms**, up from 328ms in [ep_008].\\n\\nNotably, **infrastructure metrics remain within prior ranges**:\\n- gateway-01 CPU: 37% (vs. 39% in [ep_006])\\n- service-b-01 CPU: 34% (up from 31% in [ep_008], but not alarming)\\n- metrics-db-01 disk at 79%, consistent with prior days\\n\\nThis suggests the latency spike is **not due to resource exhaustion**, but possibly a **code deployment, configuration change, or dependency issue** affecting services downstream of `/geo_lookup` and `/fraud_check`.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **Cascading Degradation: [ep_010] (January 24)**\\n\\nIn **[ep_010]**, the degradation **accelerates**:\\n- `/geo_lookup` p50: **78ms**, p95: **205ms**, p99: **260ms**\\n- `/fraud_check` p50: **74ms**, p95: **190ms**, p99: **305ms**\\n- `/checkout` p99: **390ms\", \"score\": 0.5, \"metadata\": {\"type\": \"consolidated_synthesis\"}}, {\"ref_id\": \"cascading_failure_01_ep_010\", \"text\": \"[cascading_failure_01_ep_010] 2024-01-24T10:00:00: ##

This degradation is cascading to downstream endpoints, as seen in the `/checkout` p99 latency increase to 390ms on January 24 [ref_id: synthesis].",
