Over the period from October 1 to October 15, 2024, the equity-bond correlation deteriorated from -0.38 to -0.04, nearing zero [compaction_summary]. This indicates a breakdown in the traditional diversification benefit between equities and bonds, as both asset classes began moving in tandem rather than offsetting each other.\n\nThis shift coincided with macroeconomic developments, including higher inflation surprises (e.g., PPI MoM at 0.4% vs. 0.2% expected on October 9) and rising Treasury yields (10Y UST increased from 4.13% to 4.45%) [compaction_summary]. These factors likely contributed to a repricing of risk across both markets, undermining the usual inverse relationship.\n\nFurthermore, the impact of this correlation shift is corroborated by the performance of major investment strategies. Risk Parity and Vol Targeting strategies, which rely on stable diversification benefits, turned negative by October 15, ending at -10bps and -12bps respectively [compaction_summary]. Similarly, the traditional 60-40 portfolio suffered, closing at -9bps on the same day. In contrast, Trend Following strategies delivered positive returns (+8bps on October 15), suggesting a regime change favoring momentum over diversification [compaction_summary].\n\nGiven the sustained nature of the correlation shift over two weeks, its alignment with macroeconomic drivers, and its measurable impact on strategy performance, this is unlikely to be statistical noise. Instead, it reflects a structural change in market dynamics during this period [compaction_summary].",
