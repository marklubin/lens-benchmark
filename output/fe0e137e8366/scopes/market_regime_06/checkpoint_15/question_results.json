The primary drivers of market stress identified in the summary include macroeconomic data surprises (e.g., hot PPI print on October 9), rising Treasury yields, a breakdown in equity-bond correlation, and increasing volatility (VIX rose from 15.82 to 20.64) [ref_id: compaction_summary]. Commodities like WTI and copper declined due to demand concerns and China growth skepticism, but these movements were not linked to supply chain or infrastructure disruptions such as vessel tracking or pipeline flows [ref_id: compaction_summary]. Therefore, the evidence does not support vessel or pipeline disruptions as contributors to the observed market stress.",
