Median ALT also increased from 22.7 to 26.3 U/L.\n   - AST mean in the statin subgroup decreased from 26.4 U/L to 22.1 U/L, with median dropping from 24.4 to 20.8 U/L\u2014indicating improvement or stabilization.\n   - Non-statin subgroup shows similar trends: ALT mean stable (29.9 \u2192 29.7 U/L), AST mean decreased from 26.4 to 20.7 U/L.\n   - These values remain within normal limits and show no concerning upward trend.\n\n2. **Bilirubin**:\n   - Statin subgroup bilirubin mean decreased (0.78 \u2192 0.73 mg/dL), while non-statin subgroup mean increased slightly (0.73 \u2192 0.9 mg/dL). However, even at 0.9 mg/dL, this remains within the normal range (typically <1.2 mg/dL), and no subject-level abnormalities are reported.\n\n3. **Renal Function (Creatinine and BUN)**:\n   - Creatinine mean in both subgroups decreased: statin from 1.06 to 0.85 mg/dL, non-statin from 1.1 to 0.92 mg/dL\u2014suggesting stable or improved renal function.\n   - BUN means remained stable in both groups.\n\n4. **Hematologic Parameters (WBC, Platelets)**:\n   - WBC mean increased in both subgroups (from 5.9 to 7.5 K in statin; 6.0 to 7.5 K in non-statin), but medians remained stable or slightly decreased (7.6 \u2192 7.0 K in statin; 7.8 \u2192 6.8 K in non-statin), suggesting no consistent abnormal trend.\n   - Platelet counts remained within normal range (normal ~150\u2013450 K/\u00b5L), with no concerning shifts.\n\n5. **Adverse Events**:\n   - All AEs reported are Grade 1, resolved, and primarily gastrointestinal or infectious (e.g., upper respiratory infection, nausea, diarrhea, headache) [clinical_signal_03_ep_001] and [clinical_signal_03_ep_002].\n   - No SAEs or lab-related AEs reported.\n   - Most are deemed \"possibly related\" but mild and self-limiting.\n\n6. **Enrollment and Subgroup Sizes**:\n   - Despite enrollment increasing from 40 to 60 subjects, the statin subgroup N remained constant at 52 [clinical_signal_03_ep_001] to [clinical_signal_03_ep_002], which may indicate a data reporting anomaly or fixed subgroup definition. However, lab trends remain stable regardless.\n\n**Conclusion**: Lab parameters across both statin and non-statin subgroups remain within normal clinical ranges, with no consistent or clinically significant worsening. Minor fluctuations are observed but do not suggest a safety signal. No lab-based AEs or protocol-defined safety concerns have been flagged.\n\nTherefore, **no emerging safety signals in lab panels are evident at this time** based on [clinical_signal_03_ep_001] and [clinical_signal_03_ep_002].",

Regular monitoring remains appropriate.",
    "cs03_q11_longitudinal:Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507-tput:cap2048": "The emerging safety profile of LNS-4821, based on the available log entries, indicates a pattern of mild (Grade 1), possibly related gastrointestinal and neurological adverse events (AEs), primarily in the **statin concomitant subgroup**.\n\n### Adverse Events (AEs) Profile:\nAll AEs reported across both entries are Grade 1 and resolved. However, the **statin subgroup** shows a higher frequency of **possibly related** AEs compared to the non-statin subgroup:\n\n- In [clinical_signal_03_ep_001], three out of four AEs were in the statin subgroup:\n  - AE-0001: upper respiratory infection (not related) \u2013 non-statin\n  - AE-0002: nausea (possibly related) \u2013 non-statin\n  - AE-0003: headache (possibly related) \u2013 statin [clinical_signal_03_ep_001]\n  - AE-0004: diarrhea (possibly related) \u2013 statin [clinical_signal_03_ep_001]\n\n- In [clinical_signal_03_ep_002], two out of three AEs were in the statin subgroup:\n  - AE-0005: diarrhea (possibly related) \u2013 statin [clinical_signal_03_ep_002]\n  - AE-0006: nasopharyngitis (not related) \u2013 non-statin\n  - AE-0007: nausea (possibly related) \u2013 statin [clinical_signal_03_ep_002]\n\nThus, **4 out of 7 total AEs** are in the statin subgroup, and **3 of these 4** are assessed as **possibly related** to the study drug (diarrhea, headache, nausea). In contrast, only **1 out of 3 non-statin AEs** is possibly related (nausea).\n\n### Lab Safety Signals:\nWhile lab values remain within normal reference ranges, notable shifts are observed in the **non-statin subgroup** for bilirubin:\n- Non-statin bilirubin mean increased from 0.73 mg/dL to 0.90 mg/dL [clinical_signal_03_ep_002], a ~23% rise, while statin subgroup bilirubin remained stable (0.78 \u2192 0.73 mg/dL). However, this does not correlate with other liver markers (ALT/AST), which decreased more in the non-statin group.\n\nLiver enzymes (ALT, AST) show greater improvement (decrease) in the **non-statin subgroup**, suggesting no hepatotoxic signal there. In contrast, the **statin subgroup** maintains stable or slightly increased ALT (25.5 \u2192 26.8 U/L mean) despite statins typically being associated with liver enzyme elevations.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe **statin concomitant subgroup** is most affected in terms of **possibly related AEs**, particularly gastrointestinal (nausea, diarrhea) and headache. Despite stable lab parameters, the recurrence of these AEs in statin users suggests a potential interaction or heightened sensitivity to LNS-4821 in patients on statin therapy.\n\nTherefore, the emerging safety profile of LNS-4821 is **favorable overall (all Grade 1, resolved AEs)**, but with a signal of **mild, possibly related AEs concentrated in the statin concomitant subgroup** [clinical_signal_03_ep_001, clinical_signal_03_ep_002].",
    "cs03_q12_severity:Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507-tput:cap2048": "Based on the provided log entries, the hepatic signal does not currently indicate a severe or urgent safety concern requiring immediate protocol intervention. However, careful monitoring is warranted due to subtle trends in liver enzyme levels, particularly in the statin subgroup.\n\n### Assessment of Hepatic Signal:\n\n1. **ALT and AST Trends in Statin Subgroup**:\n   - In [clinical_signal_03_ep_001], the statin subgroup had:\n     - ALT Mean: 25.5 U/L, Median: 22.7 U/L\n     - AST Mean: 26.4 U/L, Median: 24.4 U/L\n   - By [clinical_signal_03_ep_002], these values shifted to:\n     - ALT Mean: 26.8 U/L, Median: 26.3 U/L \u2192 **increase in mean and median**\n     - AST Mean: 22.1 U/L, Median: 20.8 U/L \u2192 **decrease**\n   - While ALT increased slightly (from 25.5 to 26.8), it remains well below the upper limit of normal (typically ~40\u201350 U/L). The median ALT also rose from 22.7 to 26.3, suggesting a rightward shift in distribution but still within normal range.\n\n2. **Non-Statin Subgroup Comparison**:\n   - Non-statin ALT remained stable (29.9 \u2192 29.7), and AST decreased (26.4 \u2192 20.7) [clinical_signal_03_ep_001 to 002], indicating that the statin group is not showing disproportionate elevation in transaminases.\n\n3. **Bilirubin Levels**:\n   - Bilirubin (a marker of hepatocellular injury or cholestasis) in the statin group:\n     - Mean: 0.78 \u2192 0.73 mg/dL\n     - Median: 0.74 \u2192 0.72 mg/dL\n   - These are within normal limits (<1.2 mg/dL) and show no concerning upward trend.\n\n4. **No Severe AEs Reported**:\n   - Adverse events related to gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, diarrhea) are mild (Grade 1), resolved, and possibly related to study drug in statin group subjects (AE-0004, AE-0005, AE-0007) [clinical_signal_03_ep_001 and 002].\n   - However, **no hepatic AEs (e.g., elevated LFTs, hepatitis, jaundice)** have been reported, and all AEs are Grade 1 and resolved.\n\n5. **Lab Panel N Sizes**:\n   - Statin subgroup N remains constant at 53 across both entries [clinical_signal_03_ep_001 and 002], despite enrollment increasing from 40 to 60 total subjects. This suggests that the statin subgroup is saturated or capped, possibly by protocol design.\n   - Non-statin subgroup decreased from N=131 to N=122, which may reflect data cleaning or reclassification, but no explanation is provided.\n\n### Protocol Deviations and Context:\n- Two moderate protocol deviations involving temperature excursions (PD-002 [site_11], PD-004 [site_02]) could affect drug stability, but no pattern of hepatic toxicity has emerged across sites.\n- Dose modification without PI approval (PD-005, site_05) is a moderate deviation but not directly linked to hepatic events.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Severity of Hepatic Signal**: **Low**. There is a minor increase in ALT in the statin group, but values remain within normal ranges, bilirubin is stable, and no hepatic AEs have been reported.\n- **Urgency of Protocol Intervention**: **Low urgency**. No immediate action is required. However, **continued close monitoring of LFT trends**, especially ALT in the statin subgroup, is recommended.\n- **Recommendation**: Flag for review at next DSMB meeting; consider enhanced LFT monitoring if ALT mean approaches 3\u00d7 ULN or if any Grade \u22652 hepatic AEs emerge. Currently, the signal is consistent with background variability and not indicative of drug-induced liver injury.\n\nThus, while a subtle signal exists due to rising ALT in the statin group, it is not clinically significant at this time, and no urgent protocol changes are justified based on [clinical_signal_03_ep_001] and [clinical_signal_03_ep_002].",

Similarly, in [clinical_signal_03_ep_002], the statin subgroup shows a slight increase in mean ALT to 26.8 U/L, while the non-statin subgroup remains stable at 29.7 U/L. Notably, AST levels decrease more markedly in both groups over time, but the **non-statin subgroup shows a greater decline**\u2014from 26.4 U/L to 20.7 U/L\u2014compared to the statin group\u2019s drop from 26.4 U/L to 22.1 U/L.\n\nHowever, the most significant observation is in **ALP (alkaline phosphatase)** levels. In [clinical_signal_03_ep_001], the statin subgroup has a higher mean ALP (84.9 U/L) than the non-statin group (71.9 U/L). By [clinical_signal_03_ep_002], ALP decreases in both groups but remains relatively higher in the statin group (71.0 U/L vs. 56.7 U/L in non-statin). This pattern suggests that patients on statins may have altered hepatic enzyme profiles due to chronic statin use, which is known to cause mild elevations in certain liver enzymes, though not necessarily indicative of liver injury.\n\nAdditionally, the **concomitant medication data** in both entries show a **statin count of 52**, indicating that 52 subjects are receiving statins. Given that only 60 subjects are enrolled by [clinical_signal_03_ep_002], and all 12 sites report exactly one subject per site on statins (12 total), this discrepancy suggests that the \"Statin Concomitant\" field in site-level summaries may undercount or categorize differently than the overall concomitant meds list. Still, the lab trends align with expected pharmacologic effects: statins are associated with mild transaminase elevations, but in this study, ALT remains lower in the statin group, possibly due to lipid-lowering-related hepatoprotective metabolic effects or population variability.\n\nThus, the observed differences in liver enzyme levels\u2014particularly lower ALT but higher ALP in the statin subgroup\u2014are consistent with known effects of statin therapy on hepatic enzyme expression and metabolism [clinical_signal_03_ep_001], [clinical_signal_03_ep_002].",

All sites show active enrollment, and no site-specific issues are flagged beyond isolated protocol deviations.\n\n2. **Adverse Events (AEs)**: All reported AEs across both entries are Grade 1, resolved, and either \"not related\" or \"possibly related\" [AE-0001 to AE-0007]. There is no pattern of serious adverse events (SAEs), no deaths, and no unresolved safety signals. The events (e.g., nausea, diarrhea, headache, upper respiratory infections) are mild and consistent with common background rates.\n\n3. **Lab Parameters**: \n   - In both statin and non-statin subgroups, liver enzymes (ALT, AST), renal function (creatinine, BUN), and hematologic markers (WBC, platelets) remain within normal reference ranges.\n   - While there are minor fluctuations (e.g., ALT mean in statin group increased slightly from 25.5 to 26.8 [clinical_signal_03_ep_001 \u2192 clinical_signal_03_ep_002]), these are not clinically significant and show no trend toward toxicity.\n   - Bilirubin increased in the non-statin group (from 0.73 to 0.9 mean) but remains within normal limits and does not suggest hepatotoxicity.\n\n4. **Protocol Deviations**:\n   - **PD-001**: Missed visit window (1 day late) at site_05 [clinical_signal_03_ep_001] \u2014 minor.\n   - **PD-002 & PD-004**: IP temperature excursions during shipment (2h out of range) at site_11 and site_02 \u2014 both classified as **moderate** severity [clinical_signal_03_ep_001, PD-004].

This is a more serious deviation involving protocol non-compliance in treatment administration.\n   - **PD-006**: Use of outdated consent form at site_12 \u2014 minor [clinical_signal_03_ep_002].\n\n   While **PD-005** raises a concern about adherence to protocol-specified dosing procedures, it is an isolated incident. The recurrence of temperature excursions (PD-002, PD-004) suggests a systemic risk in IP logistics.\n\n### Recommendation:\n\nThe DSMB **should not recommend protocol amendments** at this time, as there are no safety signals or efficacy concerns requiring changes to inclusion/exclusion criteria, dosing, or monitoring.\n\nHowever, the DSMB **should recommend enhanced monitoring and corrective actions** for:\n- **IP shipment handling** to prevent temperature excursions [PD-002, PD-004].\n- **Site training on dose modification procedures** to ensure PI approval is documented [PD-005].\n- **Consent form version control** at site_12 [PD-006].\n\nThese issues are operational and compliance-related, not necessitating formal protocol amendments, but rather reinforcing existing procedures through monitoring and training.\n\n\u2705 **Conclusion**: **No protocol amendments are recommended** based on current data."
