While not critical, repeated clock skew could affect logging, TLS, or distributed tracing.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe most **concerning pattern** is the **persistently high disk usage on `metrics-db-01`**, which has hovered between **78% and 82%** over four consecutive days [cascading_failure_01_ep_001 to cascading_failure_01_ep_004], despite a scheduled cleanup. If this trend continues, it risks reaching disk exhaustion, which could impact monitoring, alerting, or application functionality if the service relies on this database.\n\nAll other metrics (latency, errors, connection pools, CPU/memory) show **no signs of degradation** or cascading issues at this time. However, the disk usage trend on `metrics-db-01` warrants proactive investigation and capacity planning.",

The minor error count (e.g., 150 errors in ~123k requests) falls within typical noise levels (0.12\u20130.13% error rate) and is not indicative of a systemic failure. **No root cause can be identified because no abnormal checkout failure event is observed in the logs.**",

Additionally:\n- Latency metrics (p50, p95, p99) for `/checkout` remain stable, with no sudden spikes.\n- No alerts or events in any entry specifically reference `/checkout` failures or service degradation.\n- Connection pools show no exhaustion (waiting: 0, exhaustion: 0) [all entries], suggesting backend resource constraints are not the cause.\n- Infrastructure metrics (CPU, memory, network) on gateways and services show no signs of overload.\n\nThe only recurring infrastructure concern is **disk usage on `metrics-db-01`**, which reached 82% on 2024-01-16 [cascading_failure_01_ep_002] and remained high (80\u201379%) afterward. However, this system appears to be for metrics storage and is unlikely to directly impact `/checkout` request processing or error rates.\n\n**Conclusion**: Checkout requests are not failing due to any identified systemic issue in the logs. The low error rate (~0.12\u20130.13%) is consistent over time and likely represents transient or expected errors (e.g., client-side issues, invalid inputs).

For example:\n     - `/checkout` p99 latency fluctuates between 318ms ([cascading_failure_01_ep_003]) and 330ms ([cascading_failure_01_ep_002]), within a consistent range.\n     - Error rates are stable: `/checkout` error rate remains at 0.12\u20130.13% ([cascading_failure_01_ep_001] to [cascading_failure_01_ep_004]), with no upward trend.\n   - No endpoint reports error rates exceeding 0.13%, and success rates remain above 99.87% across all services.\n\n2. **Infrastructure Health**:  \n   - CPU, memory, and connection loads on gateways and services show normal daily variation but no signs of overload.
