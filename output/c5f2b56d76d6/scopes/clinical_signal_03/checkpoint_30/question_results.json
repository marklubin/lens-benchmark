Statin concomitant use was tracked per site, with Site 07 and Site 11 having the highest counts (7 and 5, respectively, by ep_015). By ep_030, statin concomitant subjects declined to 14, reflecting protocol amendments.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Hepatic Safety Signal: Statin Subgroup**\\nA progressive and concerning hepatic signal emerged exclusively in the **statin co-administered subgroup**, beginning in **Week 9 (ep_009)** and escalating through **Week 30**.\\n\\n- **ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase)**:  \\n  - Statin subgroup mean ALT rose from **25.5 U/L (ep_001)** to **181.8 U/L (ep_030)**, a **7.1-fold increase**.  \\n  - By **ep_010 (Week 10)**, mean ALT reached **37.2 U/L**, and by **ep_015 (Week 15)**, it was **62.2 U/L**\\u2014approaching 2x ULN (assuming ULN \\u2248 40 U/L).  \\n  - By **ep_024 (Week 24)**, mean ALT was **133.5 U/L**, and by **ep_030**, it reached **181.8 U/L**, consistent with **3\\u20134x ULN**.  \\n  - Median values closely mirrored means, indicating no extreme outliers driving the trend.\\n\\n- **AST and Bilirubin**:  \\n  - AST mean increased from **26.4 U/L (ep_001)** to **120.0 U/L (ep_030)**.  \\n  - Bilirubin mean rose from **0.78 mg/dL (ep_001)** to **3.1 mg/dL (ep_030)**, exceeding **2.5x ULN** (ULN \\u2248 1.2 mg/dL), meeting **Hy\\u2019s Law criteria** for drug-induced liver injury (DILI) risk.\\n\\n- **Non-Statin Subgroup Stability**:  \\n  - ALT remained stable: mean **29.9 U/L (ep_001)** to **28.8 U/L (ep_030)**.  \\n  - Bilirubin mean fluctuated between **0.4\\u20130.9 mg/dL**, remaining within normal limits.\\n\\nThis **cross-site, subgroup-specific signal** confirmed a **drug-drug interaction (DDI)** rather than site-specific lab error or isolated toxicity.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Adverse Events (AEs) and Safety**\\n- **Hepatic AEs**:  \\n  - First transaminase elevation AE reported in **ep_010 (AE-0032)**.  \\n  - By **ep_018**, **Hy\\u2019s Law cases** were confirmed:  \\n    - AE-0070: ALT 4.2x ULN, bilirubin 2.8x ULN (Grade 3, probably related) [ep_018].  \\n    - AE-0079: ALT 3.8x ULN, bilirubin 2.3x ULN (Grade 3) [ep_020].  \\n  - **Hepatocellular injury (Grade 3)** became recurrent: AE-0092, AE-0099, AE-0105, AE-0132 [ep_023\\u2013ep_030].  \\n  - **Jaundice (Grade 2)**: AE-0057, AE-0077, AE-0118, AE-0125, AE-0130 [ep_016\\u2013ep_030].\\n\\n- **Non-Hepatic AEs**:  \\n  - Common AEs: nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, insomnia\\u2014mostly Grade 1, possibly or unlikely related.  \\n  - No new non-hepatic safety signals identified [ep_021].\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Concomitant Medications and DDI Mechanism**\\n- **Statin count** in concomitant meds declined from **52 (ep_001)** to **14 (ep_030)**, reflecting protocol-driven discontinuation.  \\n- **PK sub-study (ep_023)** confirmed **CYP3A4 inhibition by LNS-4821**:  \\n  - Atorvastatin AUC increased **3.2-fold** in co-administered subjects.  \\n  - In-vitro **CYP3A4 Ki = 0.8 \\u00b5M**, confirming potent inhibition [ep_026].  \\n- This pharmacologic evidence established **LNS-4821 as a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor**, causing statin accumulation and hepatotoxicity.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Protocol Response and Amendments**\\n- **Initial response (ep_014\\u2013ep_016)**: Site 07 lab analyzer recalibration; re-assay confirmed persistent signal.  \\n- **DDI confirmed (ep_023)**: Pharmacology consult initiated.  \\n- **Protocol Amendment v4.0 drafted (ep_025)**:  \\n  - Exclusion of statin co-administration.  \\n  - Mandatory CYP3A4 substrate screening.  \\n- **Amendment approved (ep_027)** and implemented across all sites by **ep_029**.  \\n- **Hepatic monitoring frequency doubled** for remaining statin users (n=8 by ep_030) [ep_030].\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Operational and Data Integrity**\\n- **Protocol deviations**: 63 total; 15 moderate (mostly IP temperature excursions, dose modifications without PI approval), 48 minor (labeling, consent version, fasting window). No major deviations.  \\n- **Data management**: Query resolution rate stabilized at **94%** [ep_003, ep_029].  \\n- **System updates**: IVRS/EDC updates deployed without impacting randomization or data flow.  \\n- **Lab and drug accountability**: Regular audits confirmed no discrepancies across sites.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Conclusion**\\nA **clinically significant DDI** between **LNS-4821 and statins** was identified via progressive ALT and bilirubin elevations, culminating in **Hy\\u2019s Law cases and Grade 3 hepatocellular injury**. The signal was **exclusive to the statin subgroup**, **cross-site**, and **mechanistically confirmed** as CYP3A4 inhibition. A **protocol amendment (v4.0)** successfully mitigated risk by excluding statin co-administration. Ongoing monitoring continues for residual statin users. No other safety signals emerged.
