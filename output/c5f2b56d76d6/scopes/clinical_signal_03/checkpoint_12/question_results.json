Enrollment progressed per plan, with **Site 03** showing a notable spike: from 3 enrolled (Week 1) to 18 (Week 12), including a jump from 9 to 18 between Weeks 4 and 6 [clinical_signal_03_ep_004, clinical_signal_03_ep_006]. Withdrawals remained low (cumulative: 6), with a peak of 7 in Week 11 [clinical_signal_03_ep_011]. Screen failures fluctuated between 2 and 27, peaking in Week 11 before declining to 21 by Week 12.\\n\\nAll 12 sites contributed to enrollment, with **Site 07** and **Site 03** emerging as top recruiters. Statin concomitant use was consistently reported across sites, increasing from 2 subjects in Week 1 to 6 in Site 07 by Week 12 [clinical_signal_03_ep_001, clinical_signal_03_ep_012].\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Lab Panel Trends: Hepatic Signal in Statin Subgroup**\\nA clear and concerning trend emerged in the **statin subgroup\\u2019s hepatic function**:\\n\\n- **ALT (U/L)**: Mean ALT rose from **25.5** (Week 1) to **47.2** (Week 12), a **85% increase** [clinical_signal_03_ep_001, clinical_signal_03_ep_012]. Median ALT followed a similar trajectory (22.7 \\u2192 45.7). By Week 10, mean ALT reached **37.2**, and by Weeks 11\\u201312, it plateaued near **47.5**, consistently above baseline and approaching or exceeding 1.5\\u00d7 upper limit of normal (ULN) in clinical context [clinical_signal_03_ep_010, clinical_signal_03_ep_011, clinical_signal_03_ep_012].\\n- **AST (U/L)**: Mean AST increased from **26.4** to **41.0** over the period, with median rising from 24.4 to 41.0 [clinical_signal_03_ep_001, clinical_signal_03_ep_012].\\n- **Bilirubin, ALP, Renal Markers**: Bilirubin and ALP remained relatively stable or declined slightly. Creatinine showed minor fluctuations but no consistent trend.\\n\\nIn contrast, the **non-statin subgroup** demonstrated **stable hepatic profiles**:\\n- ALT mean declined from **29.9** to **22.0** [clinical_signal_03_ep_001, clinical_signal_03_ep_012].\\n- AST mean decreased from **26.4** to **23.5**.\\n- No sustained elevation observed.\\n\\nThis divergence suggests a **potential association between statin use and transaminase elevation**, warranting further safety review.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Adverse Events (AEs)**\\nA total of **39 AEs** were reported, all Grade 1 and resolved. Key patterns:\\n- **Statin subgroup**: 18 AEs, including **nausea (4)**, **diarrhea (3)**, **abdominal discomfort (3)**, and **headache (2)** [clinical_signal_03_ep_001, clinical_signal_03_ep_012].\\n- **Non-statin subgroup**: 17 AEs, dominated by **upper respiratory infections (5)** and **nasopharyngitis (3)**.\\n- **Transaminase-related AEs**: First reported in Week 10 (AE-0032), with two additional cases in Weeks 11\\u201312 (AE-0035, AE-0039), all in the **statin subgroup**, possibly related, Grade 1 [clinical_signal_03_ep_010, clinical_signal_03_ep_011, clinical_signal_03_ep_012]. This aligns with lab trends and strengthens signal.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Protocol Deviations**\\n26 deviations recorded, with **moderate severity** events recurring:\\n- **IP temperature excursions (2h out of range)**: 4 incidents (PD-002, PD-004, PD-015, PD-018) across Sites 02, 11, and 12 [clinical_signal_03_ep_001, clinical_signal_03_ep_002, clinical_signal_03_ep_008].\\n- **Dose modification without PI approval**: 3 incidents (PD-005, PD-022, PD-026) at Sites 05, 10, and 07 [clinical_signal_03_ep_002, clinical_signal_03_ep_009, clinical_signal_03_ep_012].\\n- **Outdated informed consent versions**: 4 minor deviations (PD-006, PD-009, PD-014, PD-021) across Sites 05, 10, 08, and 12.\\n- **Lab sample mislabeling**: 4 minor incidents, all corrected same day.\\n\\nNo pattern of severe deviations, but repeated temperature and consent issues suggest need for site retraining.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Concomitant Medications**\\nStatin use remained stable (~52\\u201356 subjects), with **ACE inhibitors (26\\u201330)**, **metformin (21\\u201324)**, and **PPIs (17\\u201319)** as common co-medications. No significant shifts that explain hepatic signal.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Operational Notes**\\n- **System Updates**: IVRS and EDC system updates deployed without impacting randomization or data integrity [clinical_signal_03_ep_005, clinical_signal_03_ep_012].\\n- **Monitoring & Audits**: Regular audits (Sites 04, 08), pharmacy reviews, and CRO oversight reports confirmed compliance [clinical_signal_03_ep_001, clinical_signal_03_ep_008].\\n- **Data Management**: Query resolution rate maintained at ~94%; backlog cleared by Weeks 11\\u201312 [clinical_signal_03_ep_003, clinical_signal_03_ep_011].\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Summary of Key Signals**\\n1. **Hepatic Safety Signal**: Statin subgroup shows **progressive, sustained elevation in ALT/AST**, not seen in non-statin group. Corroborated by transaminase-related AEs.\\n2. **Enrollment Success**: Target enrollment nearly reached (192/200 planned), with strong site performance.\\n3. **Operational Stability**: No major safety or data integrity issues; minor deviations manageable.\\n4. **Recommendation**: Initiate focused safety review of statin subgroup, including liver function trend analysis and potential risk factors (e.g., concomitant meds, dose). Consider enhanced monitoring or protocol amendment if trend continues.\", \"metadata\": {}}], \"count\": 1}",

Creatinine showed minor fluctuations but no consistent trend.\\n\\nIn contrast, the **non-statin subgroup** demonstrated **stable hepatic profiles**:\\n- ALT mean declined from **29.9** to **22.0** [clinical_signal_03_ep_001, clinical_signal_03_ep_012].\\n- AST mean decreased from **26.4** to **23.5**.\\n- No sustained elevation observed.\\n\\nThis divergence suggests a **potential association between statin use and transaminase elevation**, warranting further safety review.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Adverse Events (AEs)**\\nA total of **39 AEs** were reported, all Grade 1 and resolved. Key patterns:\\n- **Statin subgroup**: 18 AEs, including **nausea (4)**, **diarrhea (3)**, **abdominal discomfort (3)**, and **headache (2)** [clinical_signal_03_ep_001, clinical_signal_03_ep_012].\\n- **Non-statin subgroup**: 17 AEs, dominated by **upper respiratory infections (5)** and **nasopharyngitis (3)**.\\n- **Transaminase-related AEs**: First reported in Week 10 (AE-0032), with two additional cases in Weeks 11\\u201312 (AE-0035, AE-0039), all in the **statin subgroup**, possibly related, Grade 1 [clinical_signal_03_ep_010, clinical_signal_03_ep_011, clinical_signal_03_ep_012]. This aligns with lab trends and strengthens signal.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Protocol Deviations**\\n26 deviations recorded, with **moderate severity** events recurring:\\n- **IP temperature excursions (2h out of range)**: 4 incidents (PD-002, PD-004, PD-015, PD-018) across Sites 02, 11, and 12 [clinical_signal_03_ep_001, clinical_signal_03_ep_002, clinical_signal_03_ep_008].\\n- **Dose modification without PI approval**: 3 incidents (PD-005, PD-022, PD-026) at Sites 05, 10, and 07 [clinical_signal_03_ep_002, clinical_signal_03_ep_009, clinical_signal_03_ep_012].\\n- **Outdated informed consent versions**: 4 minor deviations (PD-006, PD-009, PD-014, PD-021) across Sites 05, 10, 08, and 12.\\n- **Lab sample mislabeling**: 4 minor incidents, all corrected same day.\\n\\nNo pattern of severe deviations, but repeated temperature and consent issues suggest need for site retraining.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Concomitant Medications**\\nStatin use remained stable (~52\\u201356 subjects), with **ACE inhibitors (26\\u201330)**, **metformin (21\\u201324)**, and **PPIs (17\\u201319)** as common co-medications. No significant shifts that explain hepatic signal.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Operational Notes**\\n- **System Updates**: IVRS and EDC system updates deployed without impacting randomization or data integrity [clinical_signal_03_ep_005, clinical_signal_03_ep_012].\\n- **Monitoring & Audits**: Regular audits (Sites 04, 08), pharmacy reviews, and CRO oversight reports confirmed compliance [clinical_signal_03_ep_001, clinical_signal_03_ep_008].\\n- **Data Management**: Query resolution rate maintained at ~94%; backlog cleared by Weeks 11\\u201312 [clinical_signal_03_ep_003, clinical_signal_03_ep_011].\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Summary of Key Signals**\\n1. **Hepatic Safety Signal**: Statin subgroup shows **progressive, sustained elevation in ALT/AST**, not seen in non-statin group. Corroborated by transaminase-related AEs.\\n2. **Enrollment Success**: Target enrollment nearly reached (192/200 planned), with strong site performance.\\n3. **Operational Stability**: No major safety or data integrity issues; minor deviations manageable.\\n4. **Recommendation**: Initiate focused safety review of statin subgroup, including liver function trend analysis and potential risk factors (e.g., concomitant meds, dose).
