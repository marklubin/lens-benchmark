The primary signal involves a drug-drug interaction (DDI) between LNS-4821 and statins, leading to hepatotoxicity.\\n\\n**Enrollment and Site Activity**  \\nTotal randomized subjects increased from 40 to 244, peaking at 244 on 2024-08-12 [clinical_signal_03_ep_024], then declining to 231 by 2024-08-19 [clinical_signal_03_ep_025]. Active subjects ranged from 40 to 236. Withdrawals increased from 0 to 15, with screen failures cumulative at 42 [clinical_signal_03_ep_025]. All 12 sites enrolled subjects, with Site 07 consistently among the highest enrollers (27 enrolled) [clinical_signal_03_ep_024]. Statin concomitant use was tracked per site, increasing over time (e.g., Site 01: 1 to 6 subjects) [clinical_signal_03_ep_001, clinical_signal_03_ep_024].\\n\\n**Hepatic Safety Signal in Statin Subgroup**  \\nA critical safety signal emerged in subjects receiving statins. Early lab panels showed normal hepatic values: statin subgroup ALT mean 25.5 U/L (2024-03-04) [clinical_signal_03_ep_001]. By 2024-04-29, ALT mean rose to 32.3 U/L [clinical_signal_03_ep_009], reaching 37.2 U/L by 2024-05-06 [clinical_signal_03_ep_010], 47.6 U/L by 2024-05-13 [clinical_signal_03_ep_011], and 52.4 U/L by 2024-05-27 [clinical_signal_03_ep_013]. The trend accelerated: 57.6 U/L (2024-06-03) [clinical_signal_03_ep_014], 62.2 U/L (2024-06-10) [clinical_signal_03_ep_015], 76.2 U/L (2024-06-17) [clinical_signal_03_ep_016], 89.1 U/L (2024-06-24) [clinical_signal_03_ep_017], 90.2 U/L (2024-07-01) [clinical_signal_03_ep_018], 103.2 U/L (2024-07-08 and 2024-07-15) [clinical_signal_03_ep_019, clinical_signal_03_ep_020], 111.7 U/L (2024-07-22) [clinical_signal_03_ep_021], 123.1 U/L (2024-07-29) [clinical_signal_03_ep_022], 127.9 U/L (2024-08-05) [clinical_signal_03_ep_023], 133.5 U/L (2024-08-12) [clinical_signal_03_ep_024], and 152.0 U/L (2024-08-19) [clinical_signal_03_ep_025]. Bilirubin followed a similar rise: from 0.78 mg/dL (2024-03-04) [clinical_signal_03_ep_001] to 2.41 mg/dL (2024-08-19) [clinical_signal_03_ep_025]. In contrast, the non-statin subgroup maintained stable ALT (mean 21.7\\u201331.5 U/L) and bilirubin (0.40\\u20130.89 mg/dL) throughout.\\n\\n**Adverse Events and SAEs**  \\nEarly AEs were mild and unrelated (e.g., upper respiratory infection, nausea) [clinical_signal_03_ep_001]. By 2024-05-06, \\\"transaminase measurement out of range\\\" (Grade 1) appeared in statin users [clinical_signal_03_ep_010]. Grade 2 events emerged: jaundice (AE-0057, 2024-06-17) [clinical_signal_03_ep_016], hepatic enzyme elevation (AE-0061, 2024-06-24) [clinical_signal_03_ep_017], and fatigue (AE-0069, 2024-07-01) [clinical_signal_03_ep_018]. Hy's Law cases were reported: AE-0070 (ALT 4.2x ULN, bilirubin 2.8x ULN, Grade 3, 2024-07-01) [clinical_signal_03_ep_018] and AE-0079 (ALT 3.8x ULN, bilirubin 2.3x ULN, Grade 3, 2024-07-15) [clinical_signal_03_ep_020]. Later, hepatocellular injury (AE-0092, AE-0099, AE-0104, AE-0106) and drug-induced liver injury (AE-0094, AE-0105) were reported, all \\\"probably\\\" or \\\"definitely\\\" related to study drug in statin users.\\n\\n**Concomitant Medications and DDI Mechanism**  \\nStatin use was consistently high (51\\u201356 subjects) [clinical_signal_03_ep_001\\u2013ep_025]. By 2024-08-05, PK data confirmed LNS-4821 inhibits CYP3A4, increasing atorvastatin AUC 3.2-fold [clinical_signal_03_ep_023]. This mechanistic evidence solidified the DDI hypothesis.\\n\\n**Protocol Deviations and Operational Events**  \\nCommon deviations included minor lab errors (mislabeled samples, incorrect panels) and moderate temperature excursions during IP shipment (e.g., PD-002, PD-015) [clinical_signal_03_ep_001, clinical_signal_03_ep_008]. Dose modifications without PI approval occurred at multiple sites (e.g., PD-005, PD-026) [clinical_signal_03_ep_002, clinical_signal_03_ep_012]. An instrument issue at Site 07 (2024-06-03) led to re-assays; a 12\\u201315% offset was confirmed in 2 of 8 specimens, but the cross-site pattern ruled out lab error [clinical_signal_03_ep_014, clinical_signal_03_ep_016].\\n\\n**Key Decisions and Amendments**  \\nBy 2024-07-15, a cross-site hepatic signal in statin users was confirmed [clinical_signal_03_ep_020]. A DSMB review was scheduled (2024-08-12) [clinical_signal_03_ep_024]. On 2024-08-19, the DDI mechanism was confirmed, and a protocol amendment (v4.0) was drafted to exclude statin co-administration [clinical_signal_03_ep_025].\\n\\n**Conclusion**  \\nA progressive, dose-independent hepatotoxicity signal was identified exclusively in subjects on statin therapy, escalating from mild transaminase elevations to Hy's Law cases and Grade 3 liver injury. PK data confirmed CYP3A4 inhibition by LNS-4821 as the mechanism. The signal was cross-site and consistent, leading to a protocol amendment to mitigate risk. Non-statin subjects remained stable throughout.\", \"metadata\": {}}], \"count\": 1}",

Therefore, the data do not match the expected pattern if Site 07\u2019s equipment issue were responsible; instead, they support a true biological signal linked to statin co-administration.\n\nIn conclusion, the pattern of ALT elevations is systemic and consistent across multiple sites, aligns with a known pharmacological mechanism (CYP3A4 inhibition), and is confined to statin users\u2014strongly indicating a drug-drug interaction rather than a localized lab calibration problem [ref_id: compaction_summary].",

The primary signal involves a drug-drug interaction (DDI) between LNS-4821 and statins, leading to hepatotoxicity.\\n\\n**Enrollment and Site Activity**  \\nTotal randomized subjects increased from 40 to 244, peaking at 244 on 2024-08-12 [clinical_signal_03_ep_024], then declining to 231 by 2024-08-19 [clinical_signal_03_ep_025]. Active subjects ranged from 40 to 236. Withdrawals increased from 0 to 15, with screen failures cumulative at 42 [clinical_signal_03_ep_025]. All 12 sites enrolled subjects, with Site 07 consistently among the highest enrollers (27 enrolled) [clinical_signal_03_ep_024]. Statin concomitant use was tracked per site, increasing over time (e.g., Site 01: 1 to 6 subjects) [clinical_signal_03_ep_001, clinical_signal_03_ep_024].\\n\\n**Hepatic Safety Signal in Statin Subgroup**  \\nA critical safety signal emerged in subjects receiving statins. Early lab panels showed normal hepatic values: statin subgroup ALT mean 25.5 U/L (2024-03-04) [clinical_signal_03_ep_001]. By 2024-04-29, ALT mean rose to 32.3 U/L [clinical_signal_03_ep_009], reaching 37.2 U/L by 2024-05-06 [clinical_signal_03_ep_010], 47.6 U/L by 2024-05-13 [clinical_signal_03_ep_011], and 52.4 U/L by 2024-05-27 [clinical_signal_03_ep_013]. The trend accelerated: 57.6 U/L (2024-06-03) [clinical_signal_03_ep_014], 62.2 U/L (2024-06-10) [clinical_signal_03_ep_015], 76.2 U/L (2024-06-17) [clinical_signal_03_ep_016], 89.1 U/L (2024-06-24) [clinical_signal_03_ep_017], 90.2 U/L (2024-07-01) [clinical_signal_03_ep_018], 103.2 U/L (2024-07-08 and 2024-07-15) [clinical_signal_03_ep_019, clinical_signal_03_ep_020], 111.7 U/L (2024-07-22) [clinical_signal_03_ep_021], 123.1 U/L (2024-07-29) [clinical_signal_03_ep_022], 127.9 U/L (2024-08-05) [clinical_signal_03_ep_023], 133.5 U/L (2024-08-12) [clinical_signal_03_ep_024], and 152.0 U/L (2024-08-19) [clinical_signal_03_ep_025]. Bilirubin followed a similar rise: from 0.78 mg/dL (2024-03-04) [clinical_signal_03_ep_001] to 2.41 mg/dL (2024-08-19) [clinical_signal_03_ep_025]. In contrast, the non-statin subgroup maintained stable ALT (mean 21.7\\u201331.5 U/L) and bilirubin (0.40\\u20130.89 mg/dL) throughout.\\n\\n**Adverse Events and SAEs**  \\nEarly AEs were mild and unrelated (e.g., upper respiratory infection, nausea) [clinical_signal_03_ep_001]. By 2024-05-06, \\\"transaminase measurement out of range\\\" (Grade 1) appeared in statin users [clinical_signal_03_ep_010]. Grade 2 events emerged: jaundice (AE-0057, 2024-06-17) [clinical_signal_03_ep_016], hepatic enzyme elevation (AE-0061, 2024-06-24) [clinical_signal_03_ep_017], and fatigue (AE-0069, 2024-07-01) [clinical_signal_03_ep_018]. Hy's Law cases were reported: AE-0070 (ALT 4.2x ULN, bilirubin 2.8x ULN, Grade 3, 2024-07-01) [clinical_signal_03_ep_018] and AE-0079 (ALT 3.8x ULN, bilirubin 2.3x ULN, Grade 3, 2024-07-15) [clinical_signal_03_ep_020]. Later, hepatocellular injury (AE-0092, AE-0099, AE-0104, AE-0106) and drug-induced liver injury (AE-0094, AE-0105) were reported, all \\\"probably\\\" or \\\"definitely\\\" related to study drug in statin users.\\n\\n**Concomitant Medications and DDI Mechanism**  \\nStatin use was consistently high (51\\u201356 subjects) [clinical_signal_03_ep_001\\u2013ep_025]. By 2024-08-05, PK data confirmed LNS-4821 inhibits CYP3A4, increasing atorvastatin AUC 3.2-fold [clinical_signal_03_ep_023]. This mechanistic evidence solidified the DDI hypothesis.\\n\\n**Protocol Deviations and Operational Events**  \\nCommon deviations included minor lab errors (mislabeled samples, incorrect panels) and moderate temperature excursions during IP shipment (e.g., PD-002, PD-015) [clinical_signal_03_ep_001, clinical_signal_03_ep_008]. Dose modifications without PI approval occurred at multiple sites (e.g., PD-005, PD-026) [clinical_signal_03_ep_002, clinical_signal_03_ep_012]. An instrument issue at Site 07 (2024-06-03) led to re-assays; a 12\\u201315% offset was confirmed in 2 of 8 specimens, but the cross-site pattern ruled out lab error [clinical_signal_03_ep_014, clinical_signal_03_ep_016].\\n\\n**Key Decisions and Amendments**  \\nBy 2024-07-15, a cross-site hepatic signal in statin users was confirmed [clinical_signal_03_ep_020]. A DSMB review was scheduled (2024-08-12) [clinical_signal_03_ep_024]. On 2024-08-19, the DDI mechanism was confirmed, and a protocol amendment (v4.0) was drafted to exclude statin co-administration [clinical_signal_03_ep_025].\\n\\n**Conclusion**  \\nA progressive, dose-independent hepatotoxicity signal was identified exclusively in subjects on statin therapy, escalating from mild transaminase elevations to Hy's Law cases and Grade 3 liver injury. PK data confirmed CYP3A4 inhibition by LNS-4821 as the mechanism. The signal was cross-site and consistent, leading to a protocol amendment to mitigate risk.

A DSMB review was scheduled (2024-08-12) [clinical_signal_03_ep_024]. On 2024-08-19, the DDI mechanism was confirmed, and a protocol amendment (v4.0) was drafted to exclude statin co-administration [clinical_signal_03_ep_025].\\n\\n**Conclusion**  \\nA progressive, dose-independent hepatotoxicity signal was identified exclusively in subjects on statin therapy, escalating from mild transaminase elevations to Hy's Law cases and Grade 3 liver injury.

The primary signal involves a drug-drug interaction (DDI) between LNS-4821 and statins, leading to hepatotoxicity.\\n\\n**Enrollment and Site Activity**  \\nTotal randomized subjects increased from 40 to 244, peaking at 244 on 2024-08-12 [clinical_signal_03_ep_024], then declining to 231 by 2024-08-19 [clinical_signal_03_ep_025]. Active subjects ranged from 40 to 236. Withdrawals increased from 0 to 15, with screen failures cumulative at 42 [clinical_signal_03_ep_025]. All 12 sites enrolled subjects, with Site 07 consistently among the highest enrollers (27 enrolled) [clinical_signal_03_ep_024]. Statin concomitant use was tracked per site, increasing over time (e.g., Site 01: 1 to 6 subjects) [clinical_signal_03_ep_001, clinical_signal_03_ep_024].\\n\\n**Hepatic Safety Signal in Statin Subgroup**  \\nA critical safety signal emerged in subjects receiving statins. Early lab panels showed normal hepatic values: statin subgroup ALT mean 25.5 U/L (2024-03-04) [clinical_signal_03_ep_001]. By 2024-04-29, ALT mean rose to 32.3 U/L [clinical_signal_03_ep_009], reaching 37.2 U/L by 2024-05-06 [clinical_signal_03_ep_010], 47.6 U/L by 2024-05-13 [clinical_signal_03_ep_011], and 52.4 U/L by 2024-05-27 [clinical_signal_03_ep_013]. The trend accelerated: 57.6 U/L (2024-06-03) [clinical_signal_03_ep_014], 62.2 U/L (2024-06-10) [clinical_signal_03_ep_015], 76.2 U/L (2024-06-17) [clinical_signal_03_ep_016], 89.1 U/L (2024-06-24) [clinical_signal_03_ep_017], 90.2 U/L (2024-07-01) [clinical_signal_03_ep_018], 103.2 U/L (2024-07-08 and 2024-07-15) [clinical_signal_03_ep_019, clinical_signal_03_ep_020], 111.7 U/L (2024-07-22) [clinical_signal_03_ep_021], 123.1 U/L (2024-07-29) [clinical_signal_03_ep_022], 127.9 U/L (2024-08-05) [clinical_signal_03_ep_023], 133.5 U/L (2024-08-12) [clinical_signal_03_ep_024], and 152.0 U/L (2024-08-19) [clinical_signal_03_ep_025]. Bilirubin followed a similar rise: from 0.78 mg/dL (2024-03-04) [clinical_signal_03_ep_001] to 2.41 mg/dL (2024-08-19) [clinical_signal_03_ep_025]. In contrast, the non-statin subgroup maintained stable ALT (mean 21.7\\u201331.5 U/L) and bilirubin (0.40\\u20130.89 mg/dL) throughout.\\n\\n**Adverse Events and SAEs**  \\nEarly AEs were mild and unrelated (e.g., upper respiratory infection, nausea) [clinical_signal_03_ep_001]. By 2024-05-06, \\\"transaminase measurement out of range\\\" (Grade 1) appeared in statin users [clinical_signal_03_ep_010]. Grade 2 events emerged: jaundice (AE-0057, 2024-06-17) [clinical_signal_03_ep_016], hepatic enzyme elevation (AE-0061, 2024-06-24) [clinical_signal_03_ep_017], and fatigue (AE-0069, 2024-07-01) [clinical_signal_03_ep_018]. Hy's Law cases were reported: AE-0070 (ALT 4.2x ULN, bilirubin 2.8x ULN, Grade 3, 2024-07-01) [clinical_signal_03_ep_018] and AE-0079 (ALT 3.8x ULN, bilirubin 2.3x ULN, Grade 3, 2024-07-15) [clinical_signal_03_ep_020]. Later, hepatocellular injury (AE-0092, AE-0099, AE-0104, AE-0106) and drug-induced liver injury (AE-0094, AE-0105) were reported, all \\\"probably\\\" or \\\"definitely\\\" related to study drug in statin users.\\n\\n**Concomitant Medications and DDI Mechanism**  \\nStatin use was consistently high (51\\u201356 subjects) [clinical_signal_03_ep_001\\u2013ep_025]. By 2024-08-05, PK data confirmed LNS-4821 inhibits CYP3A4, increasing atorvastatin AUC 3.2-fold [clinical_signal_03_ep_023]. This mechanistic evidence solidified the DDI hypothesis.\\n\\n**Protocol Deviations and Operational Events**  \\nCommon deviations included minor lab errors (mislabeled samples, incorrect panels) and moderate temperature excursions during IP shipment (e.g., PD-002, PD-015) [clinical_signal_03_ep_001, clinical_signal_03_ep_008]. Dose modifications without PI approval occurred at multiple sites (e.g., PD-005, PD-026) [clinical_signal_03_ep_002, clinical_signal_03_ep_012]. An instrument issue at Site 07 (2024-06-03) led to re-assays; a 12\\u201315% offset was confirmed in 2 of 8 specimens, but the cross-site pattern ruled out lab error [clinical_signal_03_ep_014, clinical_signal_03_ep_016].\\n\\n**Key Decisions and Amendments**  \\nBy 2024-07-15, a cross-site hepatic signal in statin users was confirmed [clinical_signal_03_ep_020]. A DSMB review was scheduled (2024-08-12) [clinical_signal_03_ep_024]. On 2024-08-19, the DDI mechanism was confirmed, and a protocol amendment (v4.0) was drafted to exclude statin co-administration [clinical_signal_03_ep_025].\\n\\n**Conclusion**  \\nA progressive, dose-independent hepatotoxicity signal was identified exclusively in subjects on statin therapy, escalating from mild transaminase elevations to Hy's Law cases and Grade 3 liver injury. PK data confirmed CYP3A4 inhibition by LNS-4821 as the mechanism. The signal was cross-site and consistent, leading to a protocol amendment to mitigate risk. Non-statin subjects remained stable throughout.\", \"metadata\": {}}], \"count\": 1}",
