Enrollment plateaued briefly at 184\\u2013195 subjects (weeks 10\\u201313), then surged in week 15 with +23 new enrollments.\\n\\nAll 12 sites contributed to enrollment. **Site 07** emerged as the highest enroller (23 subjects), followed by Site 03 (20) and Site 01 (22) [clinical_signal_03_ep_015]. Statin concomitant use was consistently reported across sites, with Site 07 having the highest count (7 subjects) by study end.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Lab Panel Trends**\\n#### **Statin vs. Non-Statin Subgroups**\\n- **ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase)**:  \\n  Statin subgroup ALT mean rose from **25.5 U/L** to **62.2 U/L** (+144%) [clinical_signal_03_ep_001 \\u2192 clinical_signal_03_ep_015], crossing 1.5\\u00d7 ULN (~45 U/L) by week 10 and approaching 2\\u00d7 ULN (~60 U/L) by week 15. Median ALT followed a parallel trend (22.7 \\u2192 61.3).  \\n  Non-statin subgroup ALT remained stable, fluctuating between **20.7\\u201331.5 U/L** [clinical_signal_03_ep_013 \\u2192 clinical_signal_03_ep_005], with a final mean of **26.0 U/L** [clinical_signal_03_ep_015].\\n\\n- **AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase)**:  \\n  Statin subgroup AST mean increased from **26.4 U/L** to **51.0 U/L** (+93%) [clinical_signal_03_ep_001 \\u2192 clinical_signal_03_ep_015]. Non-statin AST declined slightly, from **26.4 U/L** to **22.2 U/L** [clinical_signal_03_ep_001 \\u2192 clinical_signal_03_ep_015].\\n\\n- **Bilirubin**:  \\n  Statin subgroup bilirubin mean rose from **0.78 mg/dL** to **0.89 mg/dL** [clinical_signal_03_ep_001 \\u2192 clinical_signal_03_ep_015], remaining within normal limits. Non-statin bilirubin decreased from **0.73 mg/dL** to **0.64 mg/dL**.\\n\\n- **Renal Markers (Creatinine, BUN)**:  \\n  Both subgroups showed stable renal function. Statin creatinine mean fluctuated between **0.80\\u20131.10 mg/dL**; BUN between **13.3\\u201317.8 mg/dL**. No sustained elevation observed.\\n\\n- **Hematology**:  \\n  WBC and platelet counts remained within normal ranges. Platelet median in the statin group declined from **242 K/\\u00b5L** to **212 K/\\u00b5L** [clinical_signal_03_ep_001 \\u2192 clinical_signal_03_ep_015], suggesting a mild downward trend.\\n\\n#### **Anomaly: Site 07 Lab Calibration**\\nOn 2024-06-03, Site 07\\u2019s ALT analyzer was flagged for recalibration [clinical_signal_03_ep_014]. By 2024-06-10, re-assays were ordered for 8 specimens due to confirmed calibration offset [clinical_signal_03_ep_015]. Despite this, elevated ALT trends were observed **across multiple sites**, suggesting a systemic rather than isolated instrument issue.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Adverse Events (AEs)**\\nA total of **54 AEs** were recorded, all Grade 1 and resolved.  \\n- **Statin-related AEs**:  \\n  - **Transaminase elevation** emerged as a signal: first reported in week 10 (AE-0032), then in **5 consecutive weeks** (AE-0035, AE-0039, AE-0043, AE-0044, AE-0048, AE-0053, AE-0054) [clinical_signal_03_ep_010 \\u2192 clinical_signal_03_ep_015].  \\n  - Gastrointestinal events (nausea, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort) were recurrent and possibly related (e.g., AE-0004, AE-0027, AE-0028, AE-0041, AE-0049).  \\n- **Non-statin AEs**:  \\n  Dominated by infections (URIs, nasopharyngitis) and musculoskeletal events (arthralgia, back pain), mostly unrelated or unlikely related.\\n\\nNo SAEs reported. Transaminase elevations were consistently classified as **possibly related** to study drug, particularly in statin users.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Protocol Deviations**\\n- **Total**: 31 deviations recorded, **10 moderate**, 21 minor.  \\n- **Moderate deviations**:  \\n  - **Dose modification without PI approval**: 4 occurrences (PD-005, PD-022, PD-026, PD-031) at Sites 05, 10, 07, and 11.  \\n  - **IP temperature excursion**: 5 incidents (PD-002, PD-004, PD-015, PD-018, PD-028), all 2h out of range, across Sites 02, 08, 11, 12.  \\n- **Minor deviations**:  \\n  - Mislabeled samples (PD-003, PD-012, PD-013, PD-016, PD-030), consent version issues (PD-006, PD-009, PD-014, PD-021), and fasting window violations (PD-010, PD-019, PD-023, PD-029).  \\n- **Trend**: Deviations clustered at Sites 05, 07, 08, and 12, suggesting site-specific process gaps.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Concomitant Medications**\\n- **Statin use**: Stable at **51\\u201356 subjects** throughout, aligning with subgroup analysis.  \\n- Other common meds: ACE inhibitors (~27\\u201330), PPIs (~17\\u201319), metformin (~21\\u201324). No significant shifts suggesting confounding trends.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Operational Notes**\\n- **Drug Accountability**: Reconciled regularly; audits at Sites 04, 08, and 12 showed no discrepancies [clinical_signal_03_ep_001, clinical_signal_03_ep_011, clinical_signal_03_ep_015].  \\n- **System Updates**: IVRS/EDC updates deployed without impacting randomization or data flow.  \\n- **Monitoring & Compliance**: Site monitoring visits completed (Sites 03, 06, 07, 09, 10, 12) with findings addressed. Temperature logs compliant.  \\n- **Lab Logistics**: Central lab courier adjustments for holidays; bioanalytical shipments tracked.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Key Inferences & Trends**\\n1. **Hepatic Signal in Statin Subgroup**:  \\n   Progressive ALT/AST elevation in statin users, independent of site or lab batch, suggests a **drug-statin interaction**. The signal intensified over time, with ALT mean reaching **62.2 U/L** by week 15\\u2014near the 2\\u00d7 ULN threshold. This is corroborated by recurrent \\\"transaminase out of range\\\" AEs.\\n\\n2. **Systemic vs. Instrument Artifact**:  \\n   While Site 07\\u2019s analyzer issue raises concern, similar trends were observed across sites (e.g., Site 01, Site 05), supporting a **biological rather than technical cause**.\\n\\n3. **Safety Profile**:  \\n   No SAEs or withdrawals due to liver injury. Events were mild and resolved. However, the **consistent signal in ALT/AST** warrants intensified monitoring and potential protocol amendment.\\n\\n4. **Enrollment Surge**:  \\n   Final-week\", \"metadata\": {}}], \"count\": 1}",

Enrollment plateaued briefly at 184\\u2013195 subjects (weeks 10\\u201313), then surged in week 15 with +23 new enrollments.\\n\\nAll 12 sites contributed to enrollment. **Site 07** emerged as the highest enroller (23 subjects), followed by Site 03 (20) and Site 01 (22) [clinical_signal_03_ep_015]. Statin concomitant use was consistently reported across sites, with Site 07 having the highest count (7 subjects) by study end.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Lab Panel Trends**\\n#### **Statin vs. Non-Statin Subgroups**\\n- **ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase)**:  \\n  Statin subgroup ALT mean rose from **25.5 U/L** to **62.2 U/L** (+144%) [clinical_signal_03_ep_001 \\u2192 clinical_signal_03_ep_015], crossing 1.5\\u00d7 ULN (~45 U/L) by week 10 and approaching 2\\u00d7 ULN (~60 U/L) by week 15. Median ALT followed a parallel trend (22.7 \\u2192 61.3).  \\n  Non-statin subgroup ALT remained stable, fluctuating between **20.7\\u201331.5 U/L** [clinical_signal_03_ep_013 \\u2192 clinical_signal_03_ep_005], with a final mean of **26.0 U/L** [clinical_signal_03_ep_015].\\n\\n- **AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase)**:  \\n  Statin subgroup AST mean increased from **26.4 U/L** to **51.0 U/L** (+93%) [clinical_signal_03_ep_001 \\u2192 clinical_signal_03_ep_015]. Non-statin AST declined slightly, from **26.4 U/L** to **22.2 U/L** [clinical_signal_03_ep_001 \\u2192 clinical_signal_03_ep_015].\\n\\n- **Bilirubin**:  \\n  Statin subgroup bilirubin mean rose from **0.78 mg/dL** to **0.89 mg/dL** [clinical_signal_03_ep_001 \\u2192 clinical_signal_03_ep_015], remaining within normal limits. Non-statin bilirubin decreased from **0.73 mg/dL** to **0.64 mg/dL**.\\n\\n- **Renal Markers (Creatinine, BUN)**:  \\n  Both subgroups showed stable renal function. Statin creatinine mean fluctuated between **0.80\\u20131.10 mg/dL**; BUN between **13.3\\u201317.8 mg/dL**. No sustained elevation observed.\\n\\n- **Hematology**:  \\n  WBC and platelet counts remained within normal ranges. Platelet median in the statin group declined from **242 K/\\u00b5L** to **212 K/\\u00b5L** [clinical_signal_03_ep_001 \\u2192 clinical_signal_03_ep_015], suggesting a mild downward trend.\\n\\n#### **Anomaly: Site 07 Lab Calibration**\\nOn 2024-06-03, Site 07\\u2019s ALT analyzer was flagged for recalibration [clinical_signal_03_ep_014]. By 2024-06-10, re-assays were ordered for 8 specimens due to confirmed calibration offset [clinical_signal_03_ep_015]. Despite this, elevated ALT trends were observed **across multiple sites**, suggesting a systemic rather than isolated instrument issue.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Adverse Events (AEs)**\\nA total of **54 AEs** were recorded, all Grade 1 and resolved.  \\n- **Statin-related AEs**:  \\n  - **Transaminase elevation** emerged as a signal: first reported in week 10 (AE-0032), then in **5 consecutive weeks** (AE-0035, AE-0039, AE-0043, AE-0044, AE-0048, AE-0053, AE-0054) [clinical_signal_03_ep_010 \\u2192 clinical_signal_03_ep_015].  \\n  - Gastrointestinal events (nausea, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort) were recurrent and possibly related (e.g., AE-0004, AE-0027, AE-0028, AE-0041, AE-0049).  \\n- **Non-statin AEs**:  \\n  Dominated by infections (URIs, nasopharyngitis) and musculoskeletal events (arthralgia, back pain), mostly unrelated or unlikely related.\\n\\nNo SAEs reported. Transaminase elevations were consistently classified as **possibly related** to study drug, particularly in statin users.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Protocol Deviations**\\n- **Total**: 31 deviations recorded, **10 moderate**, 21 minor.  \\n- **Moderate deviations**:  \\n  - **Dose modification without PI approval**: 4 occurrences (PD-005, PD-022, PD-026, PD-031) at Sites 05, 10, 07, and 11.  \\n  - **IP temperature excursion**: 5 incidents (PD-002, PD-004, PD-015, PD-018, PD-028), all 2h out of range, across Sites 02, 08, 11, 12.  \\n- **Minor deviations**:  \\n  - Mislabeled samples (PD-003, PD-012, PD-013, PD-016, PD-030), consent version issues (PD-006, PD-009, PD-014, PD-021), and fasting window violations (PD-010, PD-019, PD-023, PD-029).  \\n- **Trend**: Deviations clustered at Sites 05, 07, 08, and 12, suggesting site-specific process gaps.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Concomitant Medications**\\n- **Statin use**: Stable at **51\\u201356 subjects** throughout, aligning with subgroup analysis.  \\n- Other common meds: ACE inhibitors (~27\\u201330), PPIs (~17\\u201319), metformin (~21\\u201324). No significant shifts suggesting confounding trends.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Operational Notes**\\n- **Drug Accountability**: Reconciled regularly; audits at Sites 04, 08, and 12 showed no discrepancies [clinical_signal_03_ep_001, clinical_signal_03_ep_011, clinical_signal_03_ep_015].  \\n- **System Updates**: IVRS/EDC updates deployed without impacting randomization or data flow.  \\n- **Monitoring & Compliance**: Site monitoring visits completed (Sites 03, 06, 07, 09, 10, 12) with findings addressed. Temperature logs compliant.  \\n- **Lab Logistics**: Central lab courier adjustments for holidays; bioanalytical shipments tracked.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Key Inferences & Trends**\\n1. **Hepatic Signal in Statin Subgroup**:  \\n   Progressive ALT/AST elevation in statin users, independent of site or lab batch, suggests a **drug-statin interaction**. The signal intensified over time, with ALT mean reaching **62.2 U/L** by week 15\\u2014near the 2\\u00d7 ULN threshold. This is corroborated by recurrent \\\"transaminase out of range\\\" AEs.\\n\\n2. **Systemic vs. Instrument Artifact**:  \\n   While Site 07\\u2019s analyzer issue raises concern, similar trends were observed across sites (e.g., Site 01, Site 05), supporting a **biological rather than technical cause**.\\n\\n3. **Safety Profile**:  \\n   No SAEs or withdrawals due to liver injury. Events were mild and resolved. However, the **consistent signal in ALT/AST** warrants intensified monitoring and potential protocol amendment.\\n\\n4. **Enrollment Surge**:  \\n   Final-week\", \"metadata\": {}}], \"count\": 1}",

Screen failures rose cumulatively from 2 to 33; withdrawals peaked at 10 (2024-06-03) before declining to 7 [clinical_signal_03_ep_014 \\u2192 clinical_signal_03_ep_015]. Enrollment plateaued briefly at 184\\u2013195 subjects (weeks 10\\u201313), then surged in week 15 with +23 new enrollments.\\n\\nAll 12 sites contributed to enrollment. **Site 07** emerged as the highest enroller (23 subjects), followed by Site 03 (20) and Site 01 (22) [clinical_signal_03_ep_015]. Statin concomitant use was consistently reported across sites, with Site 07 having the highest count (7 subjects) by study end.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Lab Panel Trends**\\n#### **Statin vs. Non-Statin Subgroups**\\n- **ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase)**:  \\n  Statin subgroup ALT mean rose from **25.5 U/L** to **62.2 U/L** (+144%) [clinical_signal_03_ep_001 \\u2192 clinical_signal_03_ep_015], crossing 1.5\\u00d7 ULN (~45 U/L) by week 10 and approaching 2\\u00d7 ULN (~60 U/L) by week 15. Median ALT followed a parallel trend (22.7 \\u2192 61.3).  \\n  Non-statin subgroup ALT remained stable, fluctuating between **20.7\\u201331.5 U/L** [clinical_signal_03_ep_013 \\u2192 clinical_signal_03_ep_005], with a final mean of **26.0 U/L** [clinical_signal_03_ep_015].\\n\\n- **AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase)**:  \\n  Statin subgroup AST mean increased from **26.4 U/L** to **51.0 U/L** (+93%) [clinical_signal_03_ep_001 \\u2192 clinical_signal_03_ep_015]. Non-statin AST declined slightly, from **26.4 U/L** to **22.2 U/L** [clinical_signal_03_ep_001 \\u2192 clinical_signal_03_ep_015].\\n\\n- **Bilirubin**:  \\n  Statin subgroup bilirubin mean rose from **0.78 mg/dL** to **0.89 mg/dL** [clinical_signal_03_ep_001 \\u2192 clinical_signal_03_ep_015], remaining within normal limits. Non-statin bilirubin decreased from **0.73 mg/dL** to **0.64 mg/dL**.\\n\\n- **Renal Markers (Creatinine, BUN)**:  \\n  Both subgroups showed stable renal function. Statin creatinine mean fluctuated between **0.80\\u20131.10 mg/dL**; BUN between **13.3\\u201317.8 mg/dL**. No sustained elevation observed.\\n\\n- **Hematology**:  \\n  WBC and platelet counts remained within normal ranges. Platelet median in the statin group declined from **242 K/\\u00b5L** to **212 K/\\u00b5L** [clinical_signal_03_ep_001 \\u2192 clinical_signal_03_ep_015], suggesting a mild downward trend.\\n\\n#### **Anomaly: Site 07 Lab Calibration**\\nOn 2024-06-03, Site 07\\u2019s ALT analyzer was flagged for recalibration [clinical_signal_03_ep_014]. By 2024-06-10, re-assays were ordered for 8 specimens due to confirmed calibration offset [clinical_signal_03_ep_015]. Despite this, elevated ALT trends were observed **across multiple sites**, suggesting a systemic rather than isolated instrument issue.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Adverse Events (AEs)**\\nA total of **54 AEs** were recorded, all Grade 1 and resolved.  \\n- **Statin-related AEs**:  \\n  - **Transaminase elevation** emerged as a signal: first reported in week 10 (AE-0032), then in **5 consecutive weeks** (AE-0035, AE-0039, AE-0043, AE-0044, AE-0048, AE-0053, AE-0054) [clinical_signal_03_ep_010 \\u2192 clinical_signal_03_ep_015].  \\n  - Gastrointestinal events (nausea, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort) were recurrent and possibly related (e.g., AE-0004, AE-0027, AE-0028, AE-0041, AE-0049).  \\n- **Non-statin AEs**:  \\n  Dominated by infections (URIs, nasopharyngitis) and musculoskeletal events (arthralgia, back pain), mostly unrelated or unlikely related.\\n\\nNo SAEs reported. Transaminase elevations were consistently classified as **possibly related** to study drug, particularly in statin users.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Protocol Deviations**\\n- **Total**: 31 deviations recorded, **10 moderate**, 21 minor.  \\n- **Moderate deviations**:  \\n  - **Dose modification without PI approval**: 4 occurrences (PD-005, PD-022, PD-026, PD-031) at Sites 05, 10, 07, and 11.  \\n  - **IP temperature excursion**: 5 incidents (PD-002, PD-004, PD-015, PD-018, PD-028), all 2h out of range, across Sites 02, 08, 11, 12.  \\n- **Minor deviations**:  \\n  - Mislabeled samples (PD-003, PD-012, PD-013, PD-016, PD-030), consent version issues (PD-006, PD-009, PD-014, PD-021), and fasting window violations (PD-010, PD-019, PD-023, PD-029).  \\n- **Trend**: Deviations clustered at Sites 05, 07, 08, and 12, suggesting site-specific process gaps.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Concomitant Medications**\\n- **Statin use**: Stable at **51\\u201356 subjects** throughout, aligning with subgroup analysis.  \\n- Other common meds: ACE inhibitors (~27\\u201330), PPIs (~17\\u201319), metformin (~21\\u201324). No significant shifts suggesting confounding trends.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Operational Notes**\\n- **Drug Accountability**: Reconciled regularly; audits at Sites 04, 08, and 12 showed no discrepancies [clinical_signal_03_ep_001, clinical_signal_03_ep_011, clinical_signal_03_ep_015].  \\n- **System Updates**: IVRS/EDC updates deployed without impacting randomization or data flow.  \\n- **Monitoring & Compliance**: Site monitoring visits completed (Sites 03, 06, 07, 09, 10, 12) with findings addressed. Temperature logs compliant.  \\n- **Lab Logistics**: Central lab courier adjustments for holidays; bioanalytical shipments tracked.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Key Inferences & Trends**\\n1. **Hepatic Signal in Statin Subgroup**:  \\n   Progressive ALT/AST elevation in statin users, independent of site or lab batch, suggests a **drug-statin interaction**. The signal intensified over time, with ALT mean reaching **62.2 U/L** by week 15\\u2014near the 2\\u00d7 ULN threshold. This is corroborated by recurrent \\\"transaminase out of range\\\" AEs.\\n\\n2. **Systemic vs. Instrument Artifact**:  \\n   While Site 07\\u2019s analyzer issue raises concern, similar trends were observed across sites (e.g., Site 01, Site 05), supporting a **biological rather than technical cause**.\\n\\n3. **Safety Profile**:  \\n   No SAEs or withdrawals due to liver injury. Events were mild and resolved. However, the **consistent signal in ALT/AST** warrants intensified monitoring and potential protocol amendment.\\n\\n4. **Enrollment Surge**:  \\n   Final-week\", \"metadata\": {}}], \"count\": 1}",

          "content": "Yes, there is sufficient evidence to convene a DSMB safety review. \n\nA clear and progressive hepatic signal has emerged in the statin subgroup, with ALT mean increasing from 25.5 U/L to 62.2 U/L (+144%) over 15 weeks, approaching 2\u00d7 ULN (~60 U/L) by week 15 [compaction_summary]. AST also rose significantly in this subgroup, from 26.4 U/L to 51.0 U/L (+93%) [compaction_summary]. These trends are corroborated by a series of possibly related adverse events involving transaminase elevation reported over six consecutive weeks (AE-0032, AE-0035, AE-0039, AE-0043, AE-0044, AE-0048, AE-0053, AE-0054) [compaction_summary]. \n\nAlthough no serious adverse events (SAEs) or study withdrawals due to liver injury have occurred, the signal is consistent across multiple sites and persists despite a confirmed lab calibration issue at Site 07, which suggests a biological rather than technical cause [compaction_summary]. Given the potential for drug-statin interaction and the progressive nature of the liver enzyme elevations, this constitutes a safety signal that warrants independent review by the DSMB [compaction_summary].",
