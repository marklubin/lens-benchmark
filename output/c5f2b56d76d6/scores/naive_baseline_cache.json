However, without evidence of concomitant ALT/AST elevation, this may reflect benign unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (e.g., Gilbert\u2019s syndrome), but it should be monitored.\n\n4. **ALP (Alkaline Phosphatase)**:\n   - Both subgroups show decreases:\n     - Statin: mean from **84.9 to 71.0 U/L**.\n     - Non-statin: mean from **71.9 to 56.7 U/L**.\n   - These declines suggest no cholestatic signal.\n\n5. **Renal Function (Creatinine and BUN)**:\n   - Creatinine decreased in both groups:\n     - Statin: mean from **1.06 to 0.85 mg/dL**.\n     - Non-statin: mean from **1.1 to 0.92 mg/dL**.\n   - BUN remained stable.\n   - These changes suggest **improvement** in renal parameters, not a safety signal.\n\n6. **Hematologic Parameters (WBC, Platelets)**:\n   - WBC mean increased in the statin group from **5.9 to 7.5 K**, while median decreased slightly from **7.6 to 7.0 K**\u2014a divergence that may suggest right skew but not a clear signal.\n   - Platelets remained stable in both groups.\n   - No concerning trends.\n\n### Contextual Safety Data:\n- **Adverse Events**: All AEs reported are mild (Grade 1), resolved, and primarily gastrointestinal or infectious\u2014common and expected. No SAEs or hepatobiliary events reported [clinical_signal_03_ep_001, clinical_signal_03_ep_002].\n- **Concomitant Statin Use**: Despite 52 subjects on statins, no significant lab abnormalities have emerged beyond the mild ALT increase.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThere is a **mild upward trend in ALT within the statin subgroup**, which aligns with known statin effects but is not yet clinically significant. Additionally, **bilirubin increased in the non-statin group**, which should be evaluated for potential causes. However, **no Hy\u2019s Law-like patterns** (e.g., ALT >3\u00d7 ULN + bilirubin >2\u00d7 ULN) are present, and all other lab parameters are stable or improving.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Verdict**: **No emerging safety signals at this time**, but **",

No serious adverse events (SAEs) or withdrawals due to AEs are reported in the data.\n\n### Adverse Events Profile:\n- **AE-0001** [clinical_signal_03_ep_001]: upper respiratory infection, Grade 1, not related, resolved \u2014 occurred in the **statin** subgroup.\n- **AE-0002** [clinical_signal_03_ep_001]: nausea, Grade 1, possibly related, resolved \u2014 occurred in the **non_statin** subgroup.\n- **AE-0003** [clinical_signal_03_ep_001]: headache, Grade 1, possibly related, resolved \u2014 occurred in the **statin** subgroup.\n- **AE-0004** [clinical_signal_03_ep_001]: diarrhea, Grade 1, possibly related, resolved \u2014 occurred in the **statin** subgroup.\n- **AE-0005** [clinical_signal_03_ep_002]: diarrhea, Grade 1, possibly related, resolved \u2014 occurred in the **statin** subgroup.\n- **AE-0006** [clinical_signal_03_ep_002]: nasopharyngitis, Grade 1, not related, resolved \u2014 occurred in the **non_statin** subgroup.\n- **AE-0007** [clinical_signal_03_ep_002]: nausea, Grade 1, possibly related, resolved \u2014 occurred in the **statin** subgroup.\n\n### Summary of Possibly Related AEs:\n- **Statin subgroup**: 4 out of 5 possibly/not unrelated AEs (AE-0001, AE-0003, AE-0004, AE-0005, AE-0007) \u2014 5 total AEs, 4 assessed as possibly related.\n- **Non-statin subgroup**: 1 possibly related AE (AE-0002), 1 not related (AE-0006).\n\nThus, the **statin subgroup** is disproportionately affected by AEs assessed as \"possibly related\" to LNS-4821. Specifically, gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, diarrhea) are recurring in this group.\n\nAdditionally, lab parameters show improvement or stability over time in both subgroups, with no concerning trends in liver enzymes (ALT, AST), bilirubin, or renal markers (creatinine, BUN) [clinical_signal_03_ep_001, clinical_signal_03_ep_002]. Notably, the statin subgroup shows a **decrease in mean AST** from 26.4 to 22.1 U/L and **lower mean creatinine** from 1.06 to 0.85 mg/dL, suggesting no worsening of organ function.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe emerging safety profile of LNS-4821 is favorable, with only mild, transient AEs. However, the **statin subgroup** is most affected, experiencing the majority of \"possibly related\" AEs, particularly gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, nausea) and headache. This pattern warrants further monitoring as enrollment continues, though no safety signals currently require protocol modification.",

However, careful monitoring is warranted due to observed shifts in lab values, particularly in the non-statin subgroup.\n\n### Assessment of Hepatic Signal:\n\n1. **ALT and AST Trends**:\n   - In the **statin subgroup**, ALT mean increased slightly from 25.5 U/L [clinical_signal_03_ep_001] to 26.8 U/L [clinical_signal_03_ep_002], remaining within normal limits. AST mean decreased from 26.4 U/L to 22.1 U/L [clinical_signal_03_ep_002], suggesting improvement or stability.\n   - In the **non-statin subgroup**, ALT mean remained stable (29.9 \u2192 29.7 U/L) [clinical_signal_03_ep_001 \u2192 clinical_signal_03_ep_002], but AST mean **decreased notably** from 26.4 U/L to 20.7 U/L [clinical_signal_03_ep_002], which may reflect variability rather than a safety signal.\n   - No subject-level thresholds for concern (e.g., >3\u00d7 ULN) are reported, and all group means remain within normal reference ranges for liver enzymes.\n\n2. **Bilirubin**:\n   - Bilirubin (a key marker for hepatocellular injury or cholestasis) increased in the **non-statin subgroup** from mean 0.73 mg/dL to 0.9 mg/dL [clinical_signal_03_ep_001 \u2192 clinical_signal_03_ep_002], approaching but not exceeding the upper limit of normal (~1.0\u20131.2 mg/dL). This warrants attention but does not constitute a signal of severe hepatic injury without additional context (e.g., concurrent ALT elevation >3\u00d7 ULN).\n   - The statin subgroup showed a slight decrease in bilirubin (0.78 \u2192 0.73 mg/dL) [clinical_signal_03_ep_001 \u2192 clinical_signal_03_ep_002], indicating no worsening.\n\n3. **ALP**:\n   - ALP decreased in both subgroups, more so in the non-statin group (71.9 \u2192 56.7 U/L) [clinical_signal_03_ep_001 \u2192 clinical_signal_03_ep_002], which may suggest reduced cholestatic potential or normal biological variation.\n\n4. **Adverse Events**:\n   - No hepatic-related AEs (e.g., elevated transaminases, hepatitis, jaundice) were reported in either period.\n   - Reported AEs were mild (Grade 1), including diarrhea, nausea, headache, and nasopharyngitis, none described as related to liver dysfunction [AE-0001 to AE-0007].\n\n5. **Concomitant Medications**:\n   - Statin use remained constant at 52 subjects [clinical_signal_03_ep_001 and clinical_signal_03_ep_002], with all 12 sites now reporting at least one subject on statins. Statins are known for potential hepatotoxicity, yet lab trends do not reflect a worsening signal in this subgroup.\n\n### Protocol Deviations and Operational Context:\n- Two **moderate** protocol deviations related to IP temperature excursions occurred: PD-002 [site_11] and PD-004 [site_02] [clinical_signal_03_ep_001 and clinical_signal_03_ep_002]. While temperature excursions could theoretically affect drug stability, no pattern of hepatic abnormality has emerged to suggest a product-related safety issue.\n- PD-005 (dose modification without PI approval at site_05) [clinical_signal_03_ep_002] raises compliance concerns but lacks evidence of clinical impact at this time.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Severity**: Low. There is **no current evidence of a clinically significant hepatic signal**. Lab values remain within normal ranges, and no hepatic AEs have been reported.\n- **Urgency of Protocol Intervention**: **Low urgency**. No protocol-level changes are currently justified.\n- **Recommended Actions**:\n  - Continue routine monitoring of liver enzymes, with particular attention to bilirubin trends in the non-statin group.\n  - Flag any future transaminase elevations >3\u00d7 ULN or bilirubin >2\u00d7 ULN for expedited review.\n  - Reinforce site training on protocol adherence, especially regarding dose modifications and temperature monitoring, given repeated moderate deviations.\n\nIn summary, the data do not support",

This pattern persists in [clinical_signal_03_ep_002], where the statin subgroup\u2019s mean ALT increases slightly to 26.8 U/L, while the non-statin group\u2019s mean ALT decreases slightly to 29.7 U/L \u2014 still showing higher levels in the non-statin group.\n\nHowever, a notable shift occurs in AST levels: in [clinical_signal_03_ep_001], both groups have similar mean AST (26.4 U/L), but by [clinical_signal_03_ep_002], the **statin subgroup\u2019s mean AST drops to 22.1 U/L**, while the **non-statin subgroup\u2019s mean AST drops more sharply to 20.7 U/L**. This suggests that while both groups experience changes over time, the statin group maintains relatively stable or slightly elevated ALT compared to non-statin, which may reflect subclinical hepatic effects of statin use.\n\nAdditionally, ALP levels in [clinical_signal_03_ep_001] are higher in the statin group (mean 84.9 U/L) than non-statin (71.9 U/L), but by [clinical_signal_03_ep_002], ALP decreases in the statin group (71.0 U/L) and further decreases in the non-statin group (56.7 U/L), aligning more closely with normal ranges.\n\nThese differences may be attributed to:\n- **Concomitant statin use**, reported in 52 subjects across sites ([clinical_signal_03_ep_001] and [clinical_signal_03_ep_002]), known to cause mild elevations in transaminases (ALT/AST) in some patients.\n- However, observed ALT remains within normal reference ranges and stable over time, suggesting no acute hepatotoxicity.\n- The non-statin group shows consistently higher baseline ALT, which could reflect underlying differences in metabolic profiles or other concomitant medications (e.g., metformin, NSAIDs), though no direct evidence of this is provided.\n\nThus, the difference in liver enzyme levels appears consistent with expected pharmacodynamic effects of statins \u2014 typically causing mild, asymptomatic ALT elevations \u2014 but paradoxically, in these datasets, the **non-statin group has higher ALT values**, while the **statin group shows lower or stable enzymes**, possibly due to selection bias, small subgroup sizes, or protective metabolic effects in statin users.\n\nNo related AEs (e.g., hepatitis, liver dysfunction) were reported beyond mild, resolved events like nausea and diarrhea ([AE-0004], [AE-0005], [AE-0007]), supporting that observed lab values are subclinical.\n\nTherefore, the liver enzyme differences between subgroups appear to reflect a combination of medication effects, baseline patient characteristics, and potential confounding factors not fully detailed in the logs.",

All sites show consistent activity and no enrollment halts or safety-driven pauses.\n\n2. **Adverse Events (AEs)**: All reported AEs across both entries are Grade 1, resolved, and primarily described as \"possibly related\" or \"not related.\" Examples include upper respiratory infection, nausea, headache, and diarrhea [AE-0001 to AE-0007]. These are consistent with routine, expected events and do not suggest a safety signal requiring protocol modification.\n\n3. **Lab Panels**: Liver enzymes (ALT, AST), renal function (creatinine, BUN), and other key biomarkers remain within normal reference ranges for both statin and non-statin subgroups. While there are minor fluctuations (e.g., ALT mean in statin group increased slightly from 25.5 to 26.8 [clinical_signal_03_ep_001] to [clinical_signal_03_ep_002]), these are not clinically significant or trending toward thresholds of concern (e.g., no Grade 3/4 abnormalities reported).\n\n4. **Protocol Deviations**: \n   - PD-001: Missed visit window (1 day late) \u2013 minor, single occurrence [clinical_signal_03_ep_001].\n   - PD-002 and PD-004: IP temperature excursions during shipment (2h out of range), severity moderate, at Site 11 and Site 02 [clinical_signal_03_ep_001, clinical_signal_03_ep_002]. These suggest a **recurring issue with investigational product (IP) handling during transit**, but not one that currently impacts subject safety or data integrity directly.\n   - PD-005: Dose modification without PI approval at Site 05 \u2013 moderate severity [clinical_signal_03_ep_002]. This is a compliance issue but isolated.\n   - PD-006: Outdated consent form at Site 12 \u2013 minor [clinical_signal_03_ep_002].\n\n   While these deviations highlight potential risks, particularly the **repeated temperature excursions (PD-002, PD-004)**, they do not yet constitute a pattern requiring immediate protocol amendment. However, they should trigger **operational corrective actions** (e.g., courier training, packaging review), not formal protocol changes.\n\n5. **No New Safety Signals**: No serious adverse events (SAEs), no deaths, no unexplained lab abnormalities, and no trends suggesting harm.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe DSMB **should not recommend any protocol amendments** at this time. The trial is progressing as planned with manageable, routine events. However, the DSMB may recommend **enhanced monitoring** for:\n- Temperature control during IP shipment (due to PD-002 and PD-004).\n- Protocol compliance training at Site 05 (PD-005) and Site 12 (PD-006).\n\nBut these are operational, not protocol-level, changes.\n\n\u2705 **Final Answer**: **No protocol amendments are recommended** based on current data."
