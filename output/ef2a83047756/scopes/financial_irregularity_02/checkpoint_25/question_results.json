Over time, distributor revenue increased from $27.3M in November 2024 [ref_id: financial_irregularity_02_ep_011] to $50.5M in November 2025 [ref_id: financial_irregularity_02_ep_023], yet the average deal size dropped from $137K to $150K, indicating a shift toward smaller, potentially riskier transactions. Concurrently, AR aging data across multiple periods shows deteriorating collection performance, especially in later months, though exact delinquency figures are truncated in the summaries.

Additionally, the decline in average deal size for distributors\u2014from $232K in April 2025 to $147K in January 2026\u2014suggests volume-driven revenue inflation, potentially through channel stuffing, further decoupling reported revenue from sustainable cash inflows [ref_id: financial_irregularity_02_ep_016][ref_id: financial_irregularity_02_ep_025].

For example, distributor revenue fluctuated significantly\u2014from $34.6M in April 2025 to $50.5M in November 2025, then down to $33.6M in January 2026\u2014while AR aging data across multiple periods indicates delayed collections [ref_id: financial_irregularity_02_ep_024][ref_id: financial_irregularity_02_ep_023][ref_id: financial_irregularity_02_ep_025]. Additionally, the decline in average deal size for distributors\u2014from $232K in April 2025 to $147K in January 2026\u2014suggests volume-driven revenue inflation, potentially through channel stuffing, further decoupling reported revenue from sustainable cash inflows [ref_id: financial_irregularity_02_ep_016][ref_id: financial_irregularity_02_ep_025].

While revenue has remained relatively stable or grown slightly, the cash inflow is being delayed, indicating a growing disconnect between recognized revenue and actual cash collection.\n\nFor example, Distributor Revenue increased from $27.3M in November 2024 [ref_id: financial_irregularity_02_ep_011] to $50.5M by November 2025 [ref_id: financial_irregularity_02_ep_023], yet the AR aging data shows a corresponding rise in outstanding balances, suggesting that higher sales volume is not being matched by timely payments. Similarly, Direct Sales Revenue, though fluctuating, shows a decline in average deal size from $288K in October 2025 [ref_id: financial_irregularity_02_ep_022] to $188K in November 2025 [ref_id: financial_irregularity_02_ep_023], which may indicate pressure to close smaller, potentially riskier deals to maintain revenue figures, possibly with looser credit terms.\n\nThis pattern points to aggressive revenue recognition practices\u2014potentially including extended payment terms or sales to less creditworthy customers\u2014without a corresponding improvement in cash collections, leading to a growing cash flow gap [ref_id: financial_irregularity_02_ep_023].",

          "content": "Cash from operations is consistently lagging reported revenue growth due to deteriorating accounts receivable (AR) collection performance, as evidenced by increasing AR aging balances over time. While revenue has remained relatively stable or grown slightly, the cash inflow is being delayed, indicating a growing disconnect between recognized revenue and actual cash collection.\n\nFor example, Distributor Revenue increased from $27.3M in November 2024 [ref_id: financial_irregularity_02_ep_011] to $50.5M by November 2025 [ref_id: financial_irregularity_02_ep_023], yet the AR aging data shows a corresponding rise in outstanding balances, suggesting that higher sales volume is not being matched by timely payments. Similarly, Direct Sales Revenue, though fluctuating, shows a decline in average deal size from $288K in October 2025 [ref_id: financial_irregularity_02_ep_022] to $188K in November 2025 [ref_id: financial_irregularity_02_ep_023], which may indicate pressure to close smaller, potentially riskier deals to maintain revenue figures, possibly with looser credit terms.\n\nThis pattern points to aggressive revenue recognition practices\u2014potentially including extended payment terms or sales to less creditworthy customers\u2014without a corresponding improvement in cash collections, leading to a growing cash flow gap [ref_id: financial_irregularity_02_ep_023].",

Additionally, accounts receivable over 120 days past due totaled $12.4 million, and a major distributor requested a payment plan for $6.1 million in past-due amounts, further signaling cash flow strain [financial_irregularity_02_ep_024]. Earlier in 2025, a cash forecasting variance of $4.2 million was noted, suggesting ongoing challenges in liquidity planning [financial_irregularity_02_ep_014].\n\nRegarding covenants, there is evidence of a bank line amendment in April 2025 that updated covenants on a $50 million revolver, which may indicate proactive restructuring to avoid breaches [financial_irregularity_02_ep_016]. However, no explicit covenant violations are documented in the available records. The broader context\u2014including an SEC informal inquiry, audit committee engagement of independent counsel, and financial restatement efforts\u2014suggests escalating financial and compliance pressures that could stem from or contribute to treasury stress [financial_irregularity_02_ep_025].",

Additionally, accounts receivable over 120 days past due totaled $12.4 million, and a major distributor requested a payment plan for $6.1 million in past-due amounts, further signaling cash flow strain [financial_irregularity_02_ep_024]. Earlier in 2025, a cash forecasting variance of $4.2 million was noted, suggesting ongoing challenges in liquidity planning [financial_irregularity_02_ep_014].\n\nRegarding covenants, there is evidence of a bank line amendment in April 2025 that updated covenants on a $50 million revolver, which may indicate proactive restructuring to avoid breaches [financial_irregularity_02_ep_016]. However, no explicit covenant violations are documented in the available records. The broader context\u2014including an SEC informal inquiry, audit committee engagement of independent counsel, and financial restatement efforts\u2014suggests escalating financial and compliance pressures that could stem from or contribute to treasury stress [financial_irregularity_02_ep_025].",
