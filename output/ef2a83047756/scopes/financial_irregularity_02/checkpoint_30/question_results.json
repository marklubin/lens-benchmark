      "answer_text": "Based on the financial trends observed across multiple periods, the audit committee should take the following actions:\n\n1. **Investigate the Decline in Distributor Revenue**: Distributor revenue has sharply decreased from $50.5M in November 2025 [ref_id: financial_irregularity_02_ep_023] to $6.4M in June 2026 [ref_id: financial_irregularity_02_ep_030], despite relatively stable average deal sizes. This significant drop warrants a forensic review to rule out revenue recognition issues, channel stuffing reversals, or potential fraud.\n\n2. **Assess Revenue Recognition Practices**: The decline in Service Aftermarket revenue from $12.8M in November 2025 [ref_id: financial_irregularity_02_ep_023] to $4.9M in June 2026 [ref_id: financial_irregularity_02_ep_030], coupled with fluctuating unit volumes, suggests possible irregularities in revenue timing or booking practices. The audit committee should review contracts and invoicing patterns for compliance with accounting standards.\n\n3. **Evaluate Direct Sales Trends**: Although Direct Sales revenue remained relatively stable (~$23\u201327M), there is a notable increase in average deal size\u2014from $188K in November 2025 [ref_id: financial_irregularity_02_ep_023] to $320K in June 2026 [ref_id: financial_irregularity_02_ep_030]\u2014despite a drop in units. This could indicate selective booking of larger deals, which may require scrutiny for potential manipulation.\n\n4. **Review AR Aging and Cash Flow Risks**: Although full AR Aging data is not visible, the consistent decline in revenue across channels suggests potential cash flow pressures. The audit committee should obtain and analyze detailed AR reports to assess collectability and allowance for doubtful accounts.\n\n5. **Initiate a Targeted Audit**: Given the pattern of declining revenues across multiple channels and periods, the audit committee should commission a special audit focused on revenue recognition, distributor relationships, and contract compliance to ensure financial statement accuracy and regulatory compliance.",
