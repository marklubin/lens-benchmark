      "answer_text": "Based on the first few monthly reports (January to May 2024), several financial patterns stand out:\n\n1. **Stable Total Revenue**: Overall revenue across all channels remains relatively stable, with total monthly revenue hovering around $62\u201364 million. Direct sales contribute the largest share, followed by distributor, OEM, and service aftermarket revenues.\n\n2. **Fluctuating Direct Sales Deal Sizes**: While Direct Sales Revenue increases slightly from $24.1M in January to $26.5M in April before dipping to $25.6M in May, the average deal size fluctuates significantly\u2014peaking at $306K in February with only 83 contracts, then dropping to $194K in March despite 131 contracts [financial_irregularity_02_ep_002]. This suggests variability in customer segments or pricing strategies month-to-month.\n\n3. **Declining Distributor Average Deal Size**: Distributor revenue remains fairly consistent (~$19M), but the average deal size declines from $170K in January to $152K in April, indicating either smaller deals or increased volume of lower-value contracts [financial_irregularity_02_ep_004].\n\n4. **OEM Revenue Growth with Volatility**: OEM revenue rises from $11.0M in January to $12.5M in March, though it declines slightly afterward. The average deal size varies widely\u2014from $746K in January to $423K in February, then up to $686K in April\u2014suggesting irregular large contracts rather than steady demand [financial_irregularity_02_ep_001].\n\n5. **Service Aftermarket Volume Swings**: Service Aftermarket revenue stays between $7.4M and $8.3M, but unit volume fluctuates (e.g., 155 units in February and April, down to 107 in May), with average deal size increasing as volume decreases, possibly indicating a shift toward higher-value service contracts [financial_irregularity_02_ep_005].\n\nThese patterns suggest a generally stable financial performance with notable volatility in average deal sizes across channels, particularly in Direct and OEM sales, which may warrant further investigation into sales strategy or customer concentration.",
