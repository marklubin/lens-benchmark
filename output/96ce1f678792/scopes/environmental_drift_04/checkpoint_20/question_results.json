Chromium levels remained within baseline ranges (0.9\u20135 \u00b5g/L) at upstream stations WQ-01 and WQ-02 throughout the monitoring period [ref_id].

This consistent downstream decline supports the presence of a point or concentrated source near WQ-03, rather than widespread diffuse pollution.

A significant agricultural runoff event beginning on 2024-06-14 [ep_014] intensified turbidity and nutrient loading, coinciding with rising Cr levels. By 2024-06-19, Cr at WQ-03 peaked at 58 \\u00b5g/L [ep_019], approaching the 100 \\u00b5g/L Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL), prompting compliance warnings from June 18 onward [ep_018\\u2013ep_020].

Peaks (11.4\\u201312.0) occurred during high turbidity (June 9, 12, 14) [ep_009, ep_012, ep_014], suggesting algal response to nutrient influx.\\n- **E. coli:** Ranged 28\\u2013195 CFU/100ml. Lowest (28) on June 20 [ep_020], possibly due to dilution or UV exposure.\\n- **Algal Bloom Index:** Elevated (1.7\\u20131.8) on June 6, 12, 14, 16 [ep_006, ep_012, ep_014, ep_016], correlating with nutrient pulses.\\n\\n#### **Sediment Analysis**\\n- **Total Organic Carbon (TOC):** Varied 1.52\\u20133.45%.

The spatial and temporal correlation with nutrient and turbidity spikes suggests a non-point source exacerbated by land use practices. Continued monitoring and source investigation are recommended.\", \"metadata\": {}}], \"count\": 1}",

A significant agricultural runoff event beginning on 2024-06-14 [ep_014] intensified turbidity and nutrient loading, coinciding with rising Cr levels. By 2024-06-19, Cr at WQ-03 peaked at 58 \\u00b5g/L [ep_019], approaching the 100 \\u00b5g/L Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL), prompting compliance warnings from June 18 onward [ep_018\\u2013ep_020]. Despite fluctuating weather and routine operations, the Cr plume exhibited a consistent downstream gradient, suggesting a point source near WQ-03.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Key Trends and Anomalies**\\n\\n#### **1. Chromium (Cr) Anomaly**\\n- **Baseline Cr (Days 1\\u201310):** 0.9\\u20135 \\u00b5g/L across all stations [ep_001\\u2013ep_010].\\n- **Onset of Elevation:** Cr at WQ-03 rose from 12 \\u00b5g/L (2024-06-09) [ep_009] to 18 \\u00b5g/L (2024-06-14) [ep_014], coinciding with thunderstorms and agricultural runoff.\\n- **Rapid Escalation:** Cr at WQ-03 increased sharply:\\n  - 42 \\u00b5g/L (2024-06-16) [ep_016]\\n  - 48 \\u00b5g/L (2024-06-17) [ep_017]\\n  - 52 \\u00b5g/L (2024-06-18) [ep_018]\\n  - 58 \\u00b5g/L (2024-06-19) [ep_019]\\n  - 55 \\u00b5g/L (2024-06-20) [ep_020]\\n- **Spatial Gradient:** A clear downstream attenuation was observed:\\n  - On 2024-06-19: WQ-01(4), WQ-02(4), WQ-03(58), WQ-04(37.5), WQ-05(24.9), WQ-06(15.8) [ep_019].\\n- **Compliance Status:** WARNING issued from June 18 onward due to proximity to MCL [ep_018\\u2013ep_020].\\n\\n#### **2. Turbidity and Agricultural Runoff**\\n- **Baseline Turbidity:** 3\\u20137 NTU at all stations [ep_001\\u2013ep_013].\\n- **Runoff Event (June 14\\u201315):** Heavy precipitation (0.45 in) on 2024-06-14 [ep_014] triggered agricultural runoff:\\n  - WQ-04 turbidity spiked to 45 NTU (June 14) [ep_014] and 48 NTU (June 15) [ep_015].\\n  - WQ-05 turbidity reached 32\\u201335 NTU [ep_014\\u2013ep_015].\\n  - Field notes confirm visible runoff from drainage tiles and cultivated fields [ep_014\\u2013ep_016].\\n- **Nutrient Correlation:** On 2024-06-15, WQ-04 recorded nitrate 8.2 mg/L and phosphate 0.9 mg/L [ep_015], supporting agricultural origin.\\n\\n#### **3. Conductivity and Temperature**\\n- **Conductivity Trend:** Gradual increase from 280 \\u00b5S/cm (June 1) [ep_001] to 408 \\u00b5S/cm (June 20) [ep_020] at WQ-03, mirroring Cr rise.\\n  - WQ-03 conductivity: 381 \\u00b5S/cm (June 19) \\u2192 408 \\u00b5S/cm (June 20) [ep_019\\u2013ep_020].\\n- **Temperature:** Daily maxima ranged 18.5\\u201323.0\\u00b0C, with diurnal stability. No thermal pollution detected.\\n\\n#### **4. Dissolved Oxygen (DO) and pH**\\n- **DO:** Generally 7.5\\u20138.7 mg/L. WQ-03 showed declining DO as Cr increased:\\n  - 7.0 mg/L (June 10) \\u2192 5.8 mg/L (June 18) [ep_010, ep_018].\\n- **pH:** WQ-03 exhibited acidification:\\n  - Dropped from 7.3 (June 3) [ep_003] to 6.5 (June 18) [ep_018], potentially enhancing Cr solubility.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Biological and Sediment Indicators**\\n\\n#### **Biological Indicators**\\n- **Chlorophyll a:** Fluctuated 3.0\\u201312.0 \\u00b5g/L. Peaks (11.4\\u201312.0) occurred during high turbidity (June 9, 12, 14) [ep_009, ep_012, ep_014], suggesting algal response to nutrient influx.\\n- **E. coli:** Ranged 28\\u2013195 CFU/100ml. Lowest (28) on June 20 [ep_020], possibly due to dilution or UV exposure.\\n- **Algal Bloom Index:** Elevated (1.7\\u20131.8) on June 6, 12, 14, 16 [ep_006, ep_012, ep_014, ep_016], correlating with nutrient pulses.\\n\\n#### **Sediment Analysis**\\n- **Total Organic Carbon (TOC):** Varied 1.52\\u20133.45%. Peaks (3.03\\u20133.45%) on June 4\\u20135 [ep_004\\u2013ep_005] preceded Cr rise.\\n- **Benthic Macroinvertebrate Index:** Ranged 5.0\\u20138.5. Highest (8.5) on June 8 and 11 [ep_008, ep_011], lowest (5.0) on June 3 [ep_003], no clear trend with Cr.\\n- **Sediment Oxygen Demand (SOD):** 1.14\\u20132.97 g/m\\u00b2/d. Peak (2.97) on June 16 [ep_016] coincided with turbidity and Cr spike.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Events and Field Observations**\\n- **Agricultural Activity:** Confirmed runoff from corn/soybean fields on June 14\\u201316 [ep_014\\u2013ep_016].\\n- **Beaver Dam:** Partial obstruction noted upstream of WQ-02 on June 6 [ep_006], potentially affecting flow dynamics.\\n- **Bridge Construction:** Crew notified on June 9 and 19 [ep_009, ep_019]; no direct impact observed.\\n- **Fish Kill (June 5):** Investigated near WQ-04; attributed to heat stress, not chemical toxicity [ep_005].\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Conclusion**\\nA persistent Cr contamination event centered at WQ-03 emerged mid-June, intensified by agricultural runoff, and approached regulatory thresholds by June 19. The spatial and temporal correlation with nutrient and turbidity spikes suggests a non-point source exacerbated by land use practices. Continued monitoring and source investigation are recommended.\", \"metadata\": {}}], \"count\": 1}",
