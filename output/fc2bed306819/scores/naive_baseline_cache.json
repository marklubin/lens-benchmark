All laboratory values remain within typical reference ranges, and no consistent or concerning trends are observed in either the statin or non-statin subgroups.\n\nKey observations supporting this conclusion:\n\n1. **Liver Enzymes (ALT, AST, Bilirubin, ALP):**\n   - In the statin subgroup, ALT and AST values fluctuate slightly week to week but remain within normal limits. For example:\n     - Statin ALT mean ranges from 24.6 [clinical_signal_03_ep_004] to 26.8 [clinical_signal_03_ep_002], with median values below 27 U/L.\n     - AST in the statin group peaks at 27.9 mean in week 3 [clinical_signal_03_ep_003] but drops to 23.6 by week 4 [clinical_signal_03_ep_004].\n     - Bilirubin remains below 0.86 mg/dL (mean) in all weeks, with no progressive elevation.\n   - Non-statin group shows similar stability, with ALT mean dropping to 24.6 in week 4 [clinical_signal_03_ep_004], down from 29.9 in week 1 [clinical_signal_03_ep_001].\n   - ALP values are stable or decreasing, with no pattern suggesting hepatobiliary injury.\n\n2. **Renal Function (Creatinine, BUN):**\n   - Creatinine levels remain stable:\n     - Statin group: mean ranges from 0.85 [clinical_signal_03_ep_002] to 1.06 mg/dL [clinical_signal_03_ep_004], within normal range.\n     - Non-statin group: mean ranges from 0.92 [clinical_signal_03_ep_002] to 1.01 mg/dL [clinical_signal_03_ep_004].\n   - BUN shows a slight decline over time (e.g., statin BUN mean drops from 16.9 to 13.3 mg/dL [clinical_signal_03_ep_004]), which is not indicative of renal impairment.\n\n3. **Hematologic Parameters (WBC, Platelets):**\n   - WBC and platelet counts remain within normal ranges across all weeks.\n   - Statin WBC mean varies from 5.9 [clinical_signal_03_ep_001] to 8.2 [clinical_signal_03_ep_004], but no clinical correlation (e.g., infections or inflammatory events) is noted.\n   - Platelet counts show no downward trend; median values remain stable (e.g., 234\u2013242 K/\u00b5L in statin group).\n\n4. **Consistent Investigator and Safety Notes:**\n   - Each weekly summary explicitly states: \u201cLab panels within reference ranges. Routine AEs only.\u201d [clinical_signal_03_ep_001], [clinical_signal_03_ep_002], [clinical_signal_03_ep_003], [clinical_signal_03_ep_004].\n   - No new safety signals were identified by local PIs in week 4 [clinical_signal_03_ep_004].\n\n5. **Adverse Events (AEs):**\n   - All reported AEs are Grade 1, resolved, and mostly unrelated or possibly related to study drug (e.g., nausea, headache, diarrhea), with no pattern suggesting organ toxicity.\n\nIn summary, despite enrollment increasing from 40 to 100 subjects, **lab parameters remain stable and within expected ranges**, with no consistent or clinically significant shifts over time in either subgroup. Therefore, **no emerging safety signals are evident in the lab panels** based on the available data.",
