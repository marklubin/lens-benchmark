      "answer_text": "Yes, there is sufficient evidence to escalate concerns about revenue recognition to the audit committee. Multiple risk indicators point to potential aggressive revenue practices, particularly in the distributor channel, which could compromise the quality and timing of revenue recognition.\n\nFirst, distributor revenue grew by 59% from January 2024 to March 2025, but average deal size dropped from $170K to $124K by December 2024 before rebounding, suggesting volume-driven sales that may involve channel stuffing or discounting to inflate short-term results [compaction_summary]. This is further supported by a significant year-end spike in December 2024, where distributor revenue and units reached peak levels, accompanied by 38 purchase orders in the final week, raising red flags about revenue cut-off and premature recognition [compaction_summary].\n\nSecond, accounts receivable (AR) quality has deteriorated: Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) increased by 28% from 43 to 55 days, and the 120+ days AR bucket ballooned to $11.6M in January 2025 before declining, indicating collection difficulties or potential write-offs [compaction_summary]. The current AR percentage dropped to 70% in February 2025, with 60+ days AR reaching 15.2%, well above healthy thresholds [compaction_summary]. These trends are exacerbated by auditor-noted credit limit overrides and extended payment terms (net-60) to distributors, increasing credit risk [compaction_summary].\n\nThird, despite stable gross margins and revenue growth, the Cash Conversion Ratio (CCR) declined from 0.92 to 0.72 by February 2025, signaling a growing disconnect between reported revenue and cash collections [compaction_summary]. This deterioration in cash flow efficiency, driven by working capital increases from AR and inventory builds, suggests that revenue may not be translating into realizable cash, a hallmark of low-quality earnings [compaction_summary].\n\nAlthough revenue cut-off testing passed with zero exceptions in March and June 2024, the combination of aggressive distributor growth, AR deterioration, and declining cash conversion constitutes a material risk pattern that warrants escalation to the audit committee for further investigation and oversight [compaction_summary].",
