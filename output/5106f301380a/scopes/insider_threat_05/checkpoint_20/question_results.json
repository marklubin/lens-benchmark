Access and Download Patterns**\\n- **jmorris** exhibited anomalous access behavior, downloading **133 files (1048.1 MB)** on **2024-09-21**, accessing legacy and non-core repos like `archive/project-nova-2021`, `project-sentinel/nav-systems`, and `project-beacon/comms-protocol` [insider_threat_05_ep_020]. This pattern began on **2024-09-10**, with downloads increasing from 78 files (187.7 MB) to over 1000 MB by 2024-09-21.\\n- **tchen** and **mzhang** showed stable access to core `project-atlas` repos, but **tchen** accessed `shared/toolchain` and `shared/documentation` consistently, suggesting broader system knowledge.\\n- **sbrown** frequently accessed `project-atlas/firmware` and `test-harness`, with high download volumes (e.g., 174.5 MB on 2024-09-02) [insider_threat_05_ep_001].\\n\\n#### **3. After-Hours Activity and VPN Usage**\\n- **jmorris** had the most extensive after-hours VPN sessions, including a **3.0-hour session (571 MB)** on **2024-09-19** [insider_threat_05_ep_018] and **2.9 hours (398 MB)** on **2024-09-20** [insider_threat_05_ep_019]. On **2024-09-21**, jmorris accessed the **Server Room** on a weekend (11:27) [insider_threat_05_ep_020], a rare physical access event.\\n- **sbrown**, **kwilson**, and **dlee** also had regular after-hours sessions, but with lower data transfer volumes (typically <200 MB).\\n- **mzhang** had a **2.5-hour session (61 MB)** on **2024-09-14** [insider_threat_05_ep_013], notable for low data transfer despite long duration.\\n\\n#### **4. Physical Access and USB Events**\\n- **sbrown** had multiple **USB_STORAGE** and **USB_PRINTER** block events, including allowed access on **2024-09-06** [insider_threat_05_ep_005], suggesting policy testing.\\n- **jmorris** had repeated **USB_HID** and **USB_STORAGE** blocks, with a **weekend Server Room swipe on 2024-09-21** [insider_threat_05_ep_020], a significant anomaly.\\n- **tchen** had a **USB_PRINTER allowed** event on **2024-09-20** [insider_threat_05_ep_019], contrasting with typical blocking policy.\\n\\n#### **5. Patch Compliance and Malware**\\n- Patch compliance fluctuated between **92.5% and 96.3%**, peaking on **2024-09-20** [insider_threat_05_ep_019]. Pending reboots ranged from **90\\u2013179**, with no clear correlation to security events.\\n- Malware quarantined included **AgentTesla**, **Remcos**, **Emotet**, and **Lokibot**, with no user-specific patterns. Daily samples blocked ranged from **2\\u20136**.\\n\\n#### **6. Red Team Impact**\\nA red team exercise (**SOC-2024-RT-003**) ran from **2024-09-15 to 2024-09-17**, causing DLP alert spikes (27\\u201332 alerts) and generating **HIGH**-severity test alerts [insider_threat_05_ep_015, insider_threat_05_ep_016]. Post-exercise, **jmorris\\u2019s** activity continued at elevated levels, suggesting possible exploitation of test conditions.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Summary of Concerns**\\n- **jmorris** is the primary subject of interest, with escalating DLP violations, extensive data access, long after-hours sessions, and **weekend physical access to restricted areas**.\\n- **sbrown** and **hkim** show secondary risk indicators via repeated policy violations and sensitive file access.\\n- The red team exercise may have masked or enabled insider activity, particularly on **2024-09-16\\u201317**.\\n\\nThis summary preserves critical numeric data and highlights behavioral trends, anomalies, and potential cause-effect relationships across the 20-day period.\", \"metadata\": {}}], \"count\": 1}",

Access and Download Patterns**\\n- **jmorris** exhibited anomalous access behavior, downloading **133 files (1048.1 MB)** on **2024-09-21**, accessing legacy and non-core repos like `archive/project-nova-2021`, `project-sentinel/nav-systems`, and `project-beacon/comms-protocol` [insider_threat_05_ep_020]. This pattern began on **2024-09-10**, with downloads increasing from 78 files (187.7 MB) to over 1000 MB by 2024-09-21.\\n- **tchen** and **mzhang** showed stable access to core `project-atlas` repos, but **tchen** accessed `shared/toolchain` and `shared/documentation` consistently, suggesting broader system knowledge.\\n- **sbrown** frequently accessed `project-atlas/firmware` and `test-harness`, with high download volumes (e.g., 174.5 MB on 2024-09-02) [insider_threat_05_ep_001].\\n\\n#### **3. After-Hours Activity and VPN Usage**\\n- **jmorris** had the most extensive after-hours VPN sessions, including a **3.0-hour session (571 MB)** on **2024-09-19** [insider_threat_05_ep_018] and **2.9 hours (398 MB)** on **2024-09-20** [insider_threat_05_ep_019]. On **2024-09-21**, jmorris accessed the **Server Room** on a weekend (11:27) [insider_threat_05_ep_020], a rare physical access event.\\n- **sbrown**, **kwilson**, and **dlee** also had regular after-hours sessions, but with lower data transfer volumes (typically <200 MB).\\n- **mzhang** had a **2.5-hour session (61 MB)** on **2024-09-14** [insider_threat_05_ep_013], notable for low data transfer despite long duration.\\n\\n#### **4. Physical Access and USB Events**\\n- **sbrown** had multiple **USB_STORAGE** and **USB_PRINTER** block events, including allowed access on **2024-09-06** [insider_threat_05_ep_005], suggesting policy testing.\\n- **jmorris** had repeated **USB_HID** and **USB_STORAGE** blocks, with a **weekend Server Room swipe on 2024-09-21** [insider_threat_05_ep_020], a significant anomaly.\\n- **tchen** had a **USB_PRINTER allowed** event on **2024-09-20** [insider_threat_05_ep_019], contrasting with typical blocking policy.\\n\\n#### **5. Patch Compliance and Malware**\\n- Patch compliance fluctuated between **92.5% and 96.3%**, peaking on **2024-09-20** [insider_threat_05_ep_019].

DLP Alert Volume and User Behavior**\\nDLP alerts fluctuated between 13\\u201332 daily, peaking on **2024-09-16 (32 alerts)** [insider_threat_05_ep_015], primarily due to a red team exercise (SOC-2024-RT-003). Excluding red team activity, **jmorris** consistently triggered the highest number of alerts, with 5\\u20136 alerts per day from **2024-09-10 to 2024-09-21**, often involving **box.com** as a destination. Alerts for jmorris escalated in severity, including **HIGH**-severity triggers for **ENCRYPTED_ARCHIVE_DETECT** and **SENSITIVE_KEYWORD_MATCH** (e.g., DLP-20240917-2275, DLP-20240919-5500) [insider_threat_05_ep_017, insider_threat_05_ep_018]. On **2024-09-20**, jmorris triggered a **blocked** action for a large PDF upload (DLP-20240920-8664) [insider_threat_05_ep_019], indicating policy enforcement escalation.\\n\\nOther users with recurring DLP activity:\\n- **sbrown**: Multiple **SENSITIVE_KEYWORD_MATCH** and **EXTERNAL_TRANSFER_POLICY** alerts, especially on USB and email [insider_threat_05_ep_001, insider_threat_05_ep_010].\\n- **rjohnson**: Repeated **ENCRYPTED_ARCHIVE_DETECT** and **CLOUD_UPLOAD_POLICY** violations, often involving .xlsx and .tar.gz files [insider_threat_05_ep_012, insider_threat_05_ep_018].\\n- **hkim**: Increasing alerts involving **.dwg** and **.iges** files, with **SENSITIVE_KEYWORD_MATCH** on USB and email [insider_threat_05_ep_018, insider_threat_05_ep_020].\\n\\n#### **2. Access and Download Patterns**\\n- **jmorris** exhibited anomalous access behavior, downloading **133 files (1048.1 MB)** on **2024-09-21**, accessing legacy and non-core repos like `archive/project-nova-2021`, `project-sentinel/nav-systems`, and `project-beacon/comms-protocol` [insider_threat_05_ep_020]. This pattern began on **2024-09-10**, with downloads increasing from 78 files (187.7 MB) to over 1000 MB by 2024-09-21.\\n- **tchen** and **mzhang** showed stable access to core `project-atlas` repos, but **tchen** accessed `shared/toolchain` and `shared/documentation` consistently, suggesting broader system knowledge.\\n- **sbrown** frequently accessed `project-atlas/firmware` and `test-harness`, with high download volumes (e.g., 174.5 MB on 2024-09-02) [insider_threat_05_ep_001].\\n\\n#### **3. After-Hours Activity and VPN Usage**\\n- **jmorris** had the most extensive after-hours VPN sessions, including a **3.0-hour session (571 MB)** on **2024-09-19** [insider_threat_05_ep_018] and **2.9 hours (398 MB)** on **2024-09-20** [insider_threat_05_ep_019]. On **2024-09-21**, jmorris accessed the **Server Room** on a weekend (11:27) [insider_threat_05_ep_020], a rare physical access event.\\n- **sbrown**, **kwilson**, and **dlee** also had regular after-hours sessions, but with lower data transfer volumes (typically <200 MB).\\n- **mzhang** had a **2.5-hour session (61 MB)** on **2024-09-14** [insider_threat_05_ep_013], notable for low data transfer despite long duration.\\n\\n#### **4. Physical Access and USB Events**\\n- **sbrown** had multiple **USB_STORAGE** and **USB_PRINTER** block events, including allowed access on **2024-09-06** [insider_threat_05_ep_005], suggesting policy testing.\\n- **jmorris** had repeated **USB_HID** and **USB_STORAGE** blocks, with a **weekend Server Room swipe on 2024-09-21** [insider_threat_05_ep_020], a significant anomaly.\\n- **tchen** had a **USB_PRINTER allowed** event on **2024-09-20** [insider_threat_05_ep_019], contrasting with typical blocking policy.\\n\\n#### **5. Patch Compliance and Malware**\\n- Patch compliance fluctuated between **92.5% and 96.3%**, peaking on **2024-09-20** [insider_threat_05_ep_019]. Pending reboots ranged from **90\\u2013179**, with no clear correlation to security events.\\n- Malware quarantined included **AgentTesla**, **Remcos**, **Emotet**, and **Lokibot**, with no user-specific patterns. Daily samples blocked ranged from **2\\u20136**.\\n\\n#### **6. Red Team Impact**\\nA red team exercise (**SOC-2024-RT-003**) ran from **2024-09-15 to 2024-09-17**, causing DLP alert spikes (27\\u201332 alerts) and generating **HIGH**-severity test alerts [insider_threat_05_ep_015, insider_threat_05_ep_016]. Post-exercise, **jmorris\\u2019s** activity continued at elevated levels, suggesting possible exploitation of test conditions.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Summary of Concerns**\\n- **jmorris** is the primary subject of interest, with escalating DLP violations, extensive data access, long after-hours sessions, and **weekend physical access to restricted areas**.\\n- **sbrown** and **hkim** show secondary risk indicators via repeated policy violations and sensitive file access.\\n- The red team exercise may have masked or enabled insider activity, particularly on **2024-09-16\\u201317**.\\n\\nThis summary preserves critical numeric data and highlights behavioral trends, anomalies, and potential cause-effect relationships across the 20-day period.\", \"metadata\": {}}], \"count\": 1}",
