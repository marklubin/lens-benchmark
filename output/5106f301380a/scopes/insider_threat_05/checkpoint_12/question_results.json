These alerts involved sensitive keywords and large file transfers via email and cloud services. jmorris also repeatedly accessed non-core repositories such as *archive/project-nova-2021* and *project-sentinel/avionics*, which are outside their primary project scope. Additionally, they downloaded unusually large volumes of data: 187.7 MB on 2024-09-10, 272.2 MB on 2024-09-12, and 374.5 MB on 2024-09-13\u2014the largest in the dataset [compaction_summary]. They also had multiple blocked USB device events, including USB_STORAGE and USB_HID [compaction_summary].\n\n- **User sbrown** shows significant after-hours activity, with multiple VPN sessions exceeding 2 hours, including on 2024-09-12 and 2024-09-13 [compaction_summary]. They accessed high-security zones like Server Room and Lab B during these times. sbrown also triggered DLP alerts for transferring sensitive files (.7z, .iges) to USB and via email [compaction_summary] and had a USB_HID device allowed on 2024-09-06, which was a policy deviation [compaction_summary].\n\n- **User rjohnson** triggered 9 DLP alerts, including events involving encrypted archives (.tar.gz) uploaded to OneDrive and ZIP files transferred to local USB, indicating potential data exfiltration attempts [compaction_summary].\n\n- **User dlee** triggered 7 DLP alerts, including transfers of sensitive files to USB and external systems, and showed high file download volume, though with less repository diversity than jmorris [compaction_summary].\n\n- **kwilson** and **lpatel** also exhibited unusual after-hours access. kwilson accessed the Server Room after hours on 2024-09-10, while lpatel had a 2.3-hour after-hours session on 2024-09-13, which is atypical for them [compaction_summary]. lpatel also had a USB_HID device allowed on 2024-09-12, the only such non-printer HID approval in the dataset [compaction_summary].\n\nThese patterns collectively indicate potential insider threats, particularly for jmorris and sbrown, warranting further investigation [compaction_summary].",

Access and Download Behavior**\\n- **jmorris** consistently accessed non-core repositories:  \\n  - Repeated access to *archive/project-nova-2021*, *project-sentinel/avionics*, and *project-beacon/signal-proc* \\u2014 outside primary Atlas/Beacon scope.  \\n  - On 2024-09-10, downloaded 78 files (187.7 MB) across 11 repos, including legacy and archived projects [ep_010].  \\n  - On 2024-09-12, downloaded 45 files (272.2 MB) [ep_012]; on 2024-09-13, 46 files (374.5 MB) \\u2014 largest volume in dataset [ep_013].  \\n- **dlee** and **sbrown** show high file volume but lower repo diversity.  \\n- **tchen** and **mzhang** exhibit stable, moderate access patterns.\\n\\n#### **3. After-Hours Activity (VPN & Badge Swipes)**\\n- **sbrown** has the most after-hours VPN sessions:  \\n  - 2.3-hour session on 2024-09-13 [ep_013], 2.4 hours on 2024-09-12 [ep_012], and multiple >2-hour sessions [ep_007, ep_010].  \\n  - Badge swipes at **Server Room** on 2024-09-13 [ep_013] and **Lab B** on 2024-09-12 [ep_012] \\u2014 high-security zones.  \\n- **kwilson** has frequent after-hours access:  \\n  - 2.4-hour session on 2024-09-12 [ep_012], 2.3 hours on 2024-09-13 [ep_013].  \\n  - Badge swipe at **Server Room** on 2024-09-10 [ep_010].  \\n- **lpatel** had a 2.3-hour session on 2024-09-13 [ep_013] \\u2014 unusual for a user with otherwise standard hours.  \\n- **SOC noted**: \\u201c6 after-hours sessions\\u201d on 2024-09-11 [ep_011], \\u201c3 after-hours sessions\\u201d on 2024-09-12 [ep_012].\\n\\n#### **4. USB Device Events**\\n- **Blocked devices**: 48 total events; 34 blocked, 3 allowed.  \\n- **hkim** and **jmorris** most frequent:  \\n  - hkim: 7 blocked events (USB_HID, USB_PRINTER, USB_STORAGE) across 6 days [ep_001\\u2013ep_013].  \\n  - jmorris: 6 blocked events, including USB_STORAGE on 2024-09-02 [ep_001] and USB_HID on 2024-09-13 [ep_013].  \\n- **sbrown** had a USB_STORAGE blocked on 2024-09-02 [ep_001], but USB_HID **allowed** on 2024-09-06 [ep_006] \\u2014 policy deviation.  \\n- **lpatel** had USB_HID **allowed** on 2024-09-12 [ep_012] \\u2014 only allowed non-printer HID device in dataset.\\n\\n#### **5. Patch Compliance and Endpoint Health**\\n- **Patch compliance fluctuated**:  \\n  - Peaked at **96.1%** on 2024-09-03 [ep_002], dropped to **92.8%** on 2024-09-07 [ep_007], and ended at **93.3%** on 2024-09-13 [ep_013].  \\n- **Pending reboots**: Ranged from 91 (2024-09-13 [ep_013]) to 179 (2024-09-06 [ep_006]).  \\n- **Endpoint count**: Varied between 2,441 and 2,529 \\u2014 suggests dynamic environment with device turnover.\\n\\n#### **6. Malware and Threat Landscape**\\n- **Total malware blocked**: 52 samples (avg: 4.3/day).  \\n- **Top variants**:  \\n  - *Emotet*, *Lokibot*, *Remcos* \\u2014 recurring across multiple days.  \\n  - *AgentTesla* on 2024-09-02 [ep_001], 2024-09-05 [ep_005], and 2024-09-11 [ep_011].  \\n  - *AsyncRAT* and *RedLineStealer* detected on 2024-09-10 [ep_010].  \\n- **DNS sinkhole updates**: Grew from 69 indicators (2024-09-04 [ep_004]) to 191 (2024-09-13 [ep_013]) \\u2014 increasing threat ingestion.\\n\\n#### **7. Service Accounts and Maintenance**\\n- **Service account rotations**:  \\n  - *svc-nagios-2* (2024-09-02 [ep_001]), *svc-build-5* (2024-09-03 [ep_002]), *svc-jenkins-2* (2024-09-06 [ep_006]), *svc-artifactory-3* (2024-09-07 [ep_007]), *svc-nagios-1* (2024-09-12 and 2024-09-13 [ep_012, ep_013]).  \\n- **Certificate renewals**: *siem.company.mil* queued multiple times (2024-09-05 to 2024-09-1\", \"metadata\": {}}], \"count\": 1}",

They repeatedly accessed non-core repositories such as *archive/project-nova-2021*, *project-sentinel/avionics*, and *project-beacon/signal-proc*, which are outside their primary project scope [ref_id: compaction_summary]. Additionally, jmorris downloaded 187.7 MB across 78 files on 2024-09-10, 272.2 MB on 2024-09-12, and 374.5 MB on 2024-09-13\u2014the largest volume in the dataset\u2014indicating escalating data access [ref_id: compaction_summary].\n\n- **User sbrown** exhibits anomalous after-hours behavior, with multiple VPN sessions exceeding 2 hours, including on 2024-09-12 and 2024-09-13 [ref_id: compaction_summary]. These sessions were accompanied by badge swipes at high-security zones like the Server Room and Lab B, which is unusual compared to peers [ref_id: compaction_summary].\n\n- **User kwilson** also shows elevated after-hours activity, with 2.4-hour and 2.3-hour sessions on 2024-09-12 and 2024-09-13, respectively, including a badge swipe at the Server Room on 2024-09-10 [ref_id: compaction_summary].\n\n- **User lpatel** had a 2.3-hour after-hours session on 2024-09-13, which is unusual given their otherwise standard access pattern [ref_id: compaction_summary].\n\nThese behaviors\u2014particularly jmorris\u2019s broad and increasing access to non-core repositories and large data downloads\u2014represent clear deviations from peer group norms and have been flagged as escalating concerns by the SOC [ref_id: compaction_summary].",
