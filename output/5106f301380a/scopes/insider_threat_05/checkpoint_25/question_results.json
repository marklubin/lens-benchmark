Post-exercise, alerts stabilized around 18\\u201322 daily. User **jmorris** consistently triggered the highest number of alerts, particularly for **CLOUD_UPLOAD_POLICY**, **SENSITIVE_KEYWORD_MATCH**, and **ENCRYPTED_ARCHIVE_DETECT** rules, with multiple **HIGH** severity incidents involving `.zip`, `.xlsx`, `.dwg`, and `.tar.gz` files uploaded to `box.com` [insider_threat_05_ep_017 to insider_threat_05_ep_025]. On 2024-09-25, jmorris triggered 13 of 21 total alerts, including 5 **HIGH** severity **ENCRYPTED_ARCHIVE_DETECT** events [insider_threat_05_ep_025]. Multiple SOC notes flagged jmorris for review: \\u201c5 from single user under review\\u201d (2024-09-18) [insider_threat_05_ep_018], \\u201c6 from single user under review\\u201d (2024-09-19) [insider_threat_05_ep_019], and \\u201c4 from single user under review\\u201d (2024-09-20) [insider_threat_05_ep_020].\\n\\n**Access and Download Patterns**  \\njmorris exhibited anomalous access volume, downloading up to 140 files (1475.1 MB) on 2024-09-26 [insider_threat_05_ep_025], accessing legacy and cross-project repositories including `archive/project-nova-2021`, `project-sentinel/avionics`, and `project-beacon/firmware-legacy`. This pattern began escalating on 2024-09-10 (78 files, 187.7 MB) and continued daily, peaking in volume and scope [insider_threat_05_ep_010 to insider_threat_05_ep_025]. Other users maintained stable download volumes (typically 10\\u201340 files, 50\\u2013180 MB), with **dlee**, **sbrown**, and **mzhang** showing consistent but non-anomalous activity.\\n\\n**VPN and After-Hours Activity**  \\njmorris had the longest and most frequent after-hours VPN sessions, including a 4.3-hour session on 2024-09-25 transferring 674.6 MB [insider_threat_05_ep_025] and a 3.2-hour session on 2024-09-22 transferring 601.4 MB [insider_threat_05_ep_022]. SOC notes repeatedly flagged after-hours sessions: \\u201c5 after-hours sessions\\u201d (2024-09-10) [insider_threat_05_ep_010], \\u201c6 after-hours sessions\\u201d (2024-09-11) [insider_threat_05_ep_011], and \\u201c7 after-hours sessions\\u201d (2024-09-19) [insider_threat_05_ep_019]. jmorris also accessed the facility on weekends (2024-09-21 and 2024-09-22), swiping into the Server Room at 11:27 and 10:28 respectively [insider_threat_05_ep_021, insider_threat_05_ep_022], which is unusual for non-essential personnel.\\n\\n**USB and Badge Anomalies**  \\njmorris had multiple blocked USB events, including **USB_STORAGE** on 2024-09-06 [insider_threat_05_ep_006] and **USB_PRINTER** on 2024-09-22 [insider_threat_05_ep_022]. Weekend badge swipes into the Server Room (2024-09-21, 2024-09-22) are particularly concerning given the context of data exfiltration attempts [insider_threat_05_ep_021, insider_threat_05_ep_022]. SOC notes on 2024-09-24 flagged \\u201cweekend entries for 2 users\\u201d and \\u201ccloud storage upload pattern flagged by automated correlation\\u201d [insider_threat_05_ep_024], leading to forensic holds (IR-2024166, IR-2024119, IR-2024124) [insider_threat_05_ep_024, insider_threat_05_ep_025, insider_threat_05_ep_026].\\n\\n**Patch Compliance and Malware**  \\nPatch compliance varied between 92.5% and 96.3%, dropping to 92.5% during the red team exercise (2024-09-15) [insider_threat_05_ep_015] and again to 93.2% on 2024-09-25 [insider_threat_05_ep_025]. Malware quarantined included **AgentTesla**, **Remcos**, **FormBook**, **Lokibot**, **Emotet**, and **AsyncRAT**, with no single variant dominating. Endpoint scans showed 1\\u20133 non-compliant systems daily.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\nUser **jmorris** exhibits a sustained pattern of high-risk behavior: excessive data access, repeated policy violations (especially to `box.com`), after-hours and weekend activity, and physical access to sensitive areas. The convergence of DLP alerts, VPN usage, and badge swipes strongly suggests potential data exfiltration. Immediate investigation and access restriction are recommended.\", \"metadata\": {}}], \"count\": 1}",

This pattern began escalating on 2024-09-10 (78 files, 187.7 MB) and continued daily, peaking in volume and scope [insider_threat_05_ep_010 to insider_threat_05_ep_025]. Other users maintained stable download volumes (typically 10\\u201340 files, 50\\u2013180 MB), with **dlee**, **sbrown**, and **mzhang** showing consistent but non-anomalous activity.\\n\\n**VPN and After-Hours Activity**  \\njmorris had the longest and most frequent after-hours VPN sessions, including a 4.3-hour session on 2024-09-25 transferring 674.6 MB [insider_threat_05_ep_025] and a 3.2-hour session on 2024-09-22 transferring 601.4 MB [insider_threat_05_ep_022].

Weekend badge swipes into the Server Room (2024-09-21, 2024-09-22) are particularly concerning given the context of data exfiltration attempts [insider_threat_05_ep_021, insider_threat_05_ep_022]. SOC notes on 2024-09-24 flagged \\u201cweekend entries for 2 users\\u201d and \\u201ccloud storage upload pattern flagged by automated correlation\\u201d [insider_threat_05_ep_024], leading to forensic holds (IR-2024166, IR-2024119, IR-2024124) [insider_threat_05_ep_024, insider_threat_05_ep_025, insider_threat_05_ep_026].\\n\\n**Patch Compliance and Malware**  \\nPatch compliance varied between 92.5% and 96.3%, dropping to 92.5% during the red team exercise (2024-09-15) [insider_threat_05_ep_015] and again to 93.2% on 2024-09-25 [insider_threat_05_ep_025]. Malware quarantined included **AgentTesla**, **Remcos**, **FormBook**, **Lokibot**, **Emotet**, and **AsyncRAT**, with no single variant dominating. Endpoint scans showed 1\\u20133 non-compliant systems daily.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\nUser **jmorris** exhibits a sustained pattern of high-risk behavior: excessive data access, repeated policy violations (especially to `box.com`), after-hours and weekend activity, and physical access to sensitive areas. The convergence of DLP alerts, VPN usage, and badge swipes strongly suggests potential data exfiltration.

Other users maintained stable download volumes (typically 10\\u201340 files, 50\\u2013180 MB), with **dlee**, **sbrown**, and **mzhang** showing consistent but non-anomalous activity.\\n\\n**VPN and After-Hours Activity**  \\njmorris had the longest and most frequent after-hours VPN sessions, including a 4.3-hour session on 2024-09-25 transferring 674.6 MB [insider_threat_05_ep_025] and a 3.2-hour session on 2024-09-22 transferring 601.4 MB [insider_threat_05_ep_022].

Weekend badge swipes into the Server Room (2024-09-21, 2024-09-22) are particularly concerning given the context of data exfiltration attempts [insider_threat_05_ep_021, insider_threat_05_ep_022]. SOC notes on 2024-09-24 flagged \\u201cweekend entries for 2 users\\u201d and \\u201ccloud storage upload pattern flagged by automated correlation\\u201d [insider_threat_05_ep_024], leading to forensic holds (IR-2024166, IR-2024119, IR-2024124) [insider_threat_05_ep_024, insider_threat_05_ep_025, insider_threat_05_ep_026].\\n\\n**Patch Compliance and Malware**  \\nPatch compliance varied between 92.5% and 96.3%, dropping to 92.5% during the red team exercise (2024-09-15) [insider_threat_05_ep_015] and again to 93.2% on 2024-09-25 [insider_threat_05_ep_025].

The convergence of DLP alerts, VPN usage, and badge swipes strongly suggests potential data exfiltration.

SOC notes on 2024-09-24 flagged \\u201cweekend entries for 2 users\\u201d and \\u201ccloud storage upload pattern flagged by automated correlation\\u201d [insider_threat_05_ep_024], leading to forensic holds (IR-2024166, IR-2024119, IR-2024124) [insider_threat_05_ep_024, insider_threat_05_ep_025, insider_threat_05_ep_026].\\n\\n**Patch Compliance and Malware**  \\nPatch compliance varied between 92.5% and 96.3%, dropping to 92.5% during the red team exercise (2024-09-15) [insider_threat_05_ep_015] and again to 93.2% on 2024-09-25 [insider_threat_05_ep_025]. Malware quarantined included **AgentTesla**, **Remcos**, **FormBook**, **Lokibot**, **Emotet**, and **AsyncRAT**, with no single variant dominating. Endpoint scans showed 1\\u20133 non-compliant systems daily.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\nUser **jmorris** exhibits a sustained pattern of high-risk behavior: excessive data access, repeated policy violations (especially to `box.com`), after-hours and weekend activity, and physical access to sensitive areas. The convergence of DLP alerts, VPN usage, and badge swipes strongly suggests potential data exfiltration. Immediate investigation and access restriction are recommended.\", \"metadata\": {}}], \"count\": 1}",

While patch compliance fluctuated between 92.5% and 96.3%, with a drop to 92.5% during a red team exercise on 2024-09-15 and again to 93.2% on 2024-09-25, there is no evidence that these unpatched systems were exploited to enable exfiltration [compaction_summary].\n\nInstead, the data exfiltration concerns are primarily tied to user **jmorris**, who exhibited a pattern of high-risk behavior, including excessive downloads, repeated uploads of sensitive and encrypted files to `box.com`, after-hours and weekend VPN sessions, and unauthorized physical access to the Server Room [compaction_summary]. The malware detected (e.g., AgentTesla, Remcos, Emotet) was quarantined, and no indication is given that perimeter CVEs were leveraged in the exfiltration attempts [compaction_summary].\n\nTherefore, while unpatched CVEs represent a general security risk, the current evidence points to insider activity\u2014not perimeter vulnerabilities\u2014as the likely enabler of data exfiltration.",
