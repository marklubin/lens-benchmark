A sharp spike occurred on 2024-09-15 (27 alerts) and 2024-09-16 (32 alerts), attributed to **active red team exercise SOC-2024-RT-003** [insider_threat_05_ep_015, 016]. Excluding these days, average DLP alerts were 16.8/day.\\n- **User jmorris** emerged as a consistent outlier:\\n  - Triggered DLP alerts on **10 of 15 days**, with 18 total alerts.\\n  - Frequent triggers: *SENSITIVE_KEYWORD_MATCH* (6), *FILE_SIZE_THRESHOLD* (5), *BULK_DOWNLOAD_POLICY* (4).\\n  - On 2024-09-10, accessed **11 repositories**, including legacy and archived projects (e.g., `archive/project-nova-2021`, `project-sentinel/avionics`) [insider_threat_05_ep_010], suggesting broad, atypical access.\\n  - Downloaded **512.9 MB** on 2024-09-16 [insider_threat_05_ep_016], the highest single-day volume observed.\\n- **User sbrown** triggered alerts involving **sensitive keywords** (e.g., `.iges`, `.7z`) and **external transfers** to USB and OneDrive [insider_threat_05_ep_001, 005, 015], with multiple blocked USB storage attempts [insider_threat_05_ep_001, 015].\\n- **User dlee** frequently triggered *ENCRYPTED_ARCHIVE_DETECT* and *EXTERNAL_TRANSFER_POLICY* rules, including `.tar.gz` and `.dwg` files sent via email [insider_threat_05_ep_003, 012].\\n\\n#### **2. After-Hours Access & VPN Activity**\\n- **sbrown**, **kwilson**, and **lpatel** showed consistent after-hours VPN use:\\n  - **sbrown**: 10 after-hours sessions, longest duration 2.4 hrs (2024-09-11) [insider_threat_05_ep_011], transferring up to **192.96 MB** in one session [insider_threat_05_ep_009].\\n  - **kwilson**: 9 sessions, peak transfer **194.1 MB** (2024-09-08) [insider_threat_05_ep_008].\\n  - **lpatel**: 7 sessions, including a 2.3-hr session transferring **181.67 MB** (2024-09-04) [insider_threat_05_ep_004].\\n- **hkim** had multiple early-morning USB block events (e.g., 05:50, 05:12) [insider_threat_05_ep_006, 008], suggesting non-standard work patterns.\\n\\n#### **3. Physical Access & USB Events**\\n- **Server Room Access**:\\n  - **dlee** and **mzhang** swiped into the **Server Room** on 2024-09-03 [insider_threat_05_ep_003].\\n  - **kwilson** and **agarcia** accessed it on 2024-09-10 [insider_threat_05_ep_010].\\n  - **sbrown** accessed it on 2024-09-13 [insider_threat_05_ep_013] and 2024-09-16 [insider_threat_05_ep_016], correlating with USB block events.\\n- **USB Events**:\\n  - **Blocked USB_STORAGE**: 12 instances across users; **hkim**, **kwilson**, and **dlee** each had 3+ blocks.\\n  - **Allowed USB_STORAGE**: Only **sbrown** (2024-09-06) and **dlee** (2024-09-16) had allowed events [insider_threat_05_ep_006, 016], both during periods of high DLP activity.\\n  - **USB_PRINTER allowed**: **hkim** on 2024-09-09 [insider_threat_05_ep_009], unusual as most printer access was blocked.\\n\\n#### **4. Patch Compliance & Endpoint Health**\\n- **Patch Compliance** fluctuated between **92.5% and 96.1%**, with a low on 2024-09-15 (92.5%) and high on 2024-09-03 (96.1%) [insider_threat_05_ep_002, 015].\\n- **Pending Reboots**: Ranged from 91 (2024-09-13) to 179 (2024-09-06) [insider_threat_05_ep_006, 013], indicating persistent endpoint management challenges.\\n- **Non-compliant Endpoints**: 1\\u20133 hosts per scan, with no resolution trend.\\n\\n#### **5.

Red Team Activity & Alert Noise**\\n- **Red Team Exercise (SOC-2024-RT-003)** began on 2024-09-15 [insider_threat_05_ep_015]:\\n  - Triggered **12 MEDIUM alerts** on 2024-09-16 [insider_threat_05_ep_016].\\n  - Accounts `redteam-1`, `redteam-2`, `redteam-3` generated DLP alerts mimicking insider behavior (e.g., encrypted archives, bulk uploads to Box.com).\\n  - SOC implemented IP exclusions to reduce noise [insider_threat_05_ep_016].\\n\\n#### **7. Administrative & Operational Events**\\n- **Service Account Rotations**: 8 rotations across `svc-nagios`, `svc-jenkins`, `svc-build`, `svc-artifactory` [insider_threat_05_ep_001\\u2013016], indicating active credential hygiene.\\n- **Firewall Rules**: 12 new rules approved, primarily for vendor and staging subnets.\\n- **Certificate Renewals**: Queued for `siem.company.mil`, `vpn.company.mil`, and `mail.company.mil`.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Summary of High-Risk Indicators**\\n- **jmorris**: Excessive repository access, repeated DLP violations, large data volumes, and access to legacy systems suggest potential data aggregation behavior.\\n- **sbrown**: Repeated sensitive keyword matches, USB storage attempts, and Server Room access raise concerns about data exfiltration.\\n- **dlee & hkim**: Frequent USB blocks, early/late access, and encrypted archive usage indicate non-standard device usage patterns.\\n- **Red Team Impact**: DLP alert volume doubled during exercise, highlighting potential for adversarial simulation to mask real threats.\\n\\nThis summary preserves critical numeric data and identifies behavioral trends, access anomalies, and operational changes across the 15-day period.\", \"metadata\": {}}], \"count\": 1}",
