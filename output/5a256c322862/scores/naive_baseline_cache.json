The issues are progressive and indicate underlying performance degradation and systemic strain.\n\n### 1. **Degrading Performance and Increasing Errors in IDP Endpoints**\nThe `/sso_sessions` endpoint shows a deteriorating trend in error rates and latency:\n- On **2026-01-03** [cascading_failure_01_dx_002], `/sso_sessions` had 810 errors (0.66%).\n- By **2026-01-04** [cascading_failure_01_dx_003], errors increased to **1,024 (0.88%)**, and p95/p99 latencies were abnormally fixed at 43.1ms\u2014suggesting potential metric truncation or system saturation.\n- On **2026-01-05** [cascading_failure_01_dx_004], errors dropped slightly to **747 (0.56%)**, but p95/p99 latencies were reported as 0ms, which is physically implausible and likely indicates a monitoring or instrumentation failure.\n- On **2026-01-06** [cascading_failure_01_dx_005], errors spiked to **1,158 (0.82%)**, and p95/p99 were missing (N/A), suggesting continued telemetry degradation.\n\nThis pattern\u2014fluctuating but high error rates, missing or invalid latency data\u2014points to instability in the IDP system.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Critical Latency Spikes in Key Audit and Admin Endpoints**\nSeveral endpoints exhibit extreme latency:\n- `/privileged_access` on **2026-01-04** [cascading_failure_01_dx_003] reports p50 latency of **19.1 minutes**\u2014an alarming delay for an authentication-related endpoint.\n- `/rbac_changes` on **2026-01-05** [cascading_failure_01_dx_004] shows p50 latency of **44 minutes**, indicating severe processing delays in role management.\n\nThese latencies suggest that critical security operations are being delayed, increasing risk during incidents.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Audit Pipeline Ingest Lag and Event Drops**\nThe audit pipeline is under stress:\n- On **2026-01-04** [cascading_failure_01_dx_003], `/audit_pipeline` p95 latency jumped to **12.4 seconds**, and **248 events were dropped**.\n- On **2026-01-06** [cascading_failure_01_dx_005], p95 latency reached **15.2 seconds**, and the on-call engineer had to scale audit workers and tune batch intervals to mitigate lag.\n- Alerts such as **[WARNING] audit ingest lag p95 after event enrichment** [cascading_failure_01_dx_003] and **[WARNING] audit pipeline drop rate approaching threshold** [cascading_failure_01_dx_008] confirm systemic backpressure.\n\nThis indicates that audit data\u2014critical for compliance and security\u2014is being delayed or lost.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Connection Pool Exhaustion and Resource Pressure**\nOn **2026-01-07** [cascading_failure_01_dx_006], connection pools for `idp-api-01` and `idp-api-02` show:\n- `waiting: 5`, `exhaustion: 2` and `waiting: 4`, `exhaustion: 1` respectively.\n- `avg_wait: 12\u201315ms` suggests queuing delays.\n\nThis is a strong indicator that the IDP API instances are nearing capacity and unable to handle concurrent requests efficiently.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Recurring SAML and OIDC Failures**\nSecurity protocol errors persist:\n- **SAML assertion errors** appear repeatedly:\n  - 18 reported on **2026-01-03** [cascading_failure_01_dx_002].\n  - 19 on **2026-01-08** [cascading_failure_01_dx_007].\n  - **12 SEVERE alerts** on **2026-01-09** [cascading_failure_01_dx_008].\n- OIDC discovery errors also recur, with **28 errors**",

    "cf01_q24_evidence:qwen-3-235b-a22b-instruct-2507:cap8192": "Yes, there is sufficient evidence to begin investigating a specific root cause for the emerging service patterns, particularly within the **authentication and audit subsystems**. A clear degradation trend is observable across multiple log entries, with correlated performance issues, infrastructure strain, and operational interventions pointing to **audit pipeline backpressure and connection pool exhaustion** as a likely root cause.\n\n### Key Evidence:\n\n1. **Degrading Performance in Audit Pipeline and Token Operations:**\n   - On 2026-01-04 [cascading_failure_01_dx_003], `/audit_pipeline` p50 latency jumps to **12.4 seconds** (from 7ms on 2026-01-03 [cascading_failure_01_dx_002]), and `/token_ops` latency drops to **0ms**, which is anomalous and suggests instrumentation or processing failure.\n   - Concurrently, `/privileged_access` shows **19.1min** p50 latency, indicating severe processing delays.\n   - Connection pools on `idp-api-01` and `idp-api-02` show **waiting=5 and 3**, with **avg_wait=15ms and 12ms**, indicating contention [cascading_failure_01_dx_003].\n\n2. **Infrastructure and Alert Correlation:**\n   - On 2026-01-05 [cascading_failure_01_dx_004], `/token_ops` p50 latency spikes to **171ms**, suggesting recovery from prior anomaly but still elevated.\n   - On 2026-01-06 [cascading_failure_01_dx_005], **SAML assertion errors spike to 28**, and **OIDC discovery errors increase**, indicating authentication health degradation.\n   - Audit worker CPU rises to **79%**, audit-db CPU to **46%**, and replication lag increases to **1.1 sec** [cascading_failure_01_dx_005], signaling backend strain.\n\n3. **Operational Interventions Confirm Hypothesis:**\n   - On 2026-01-06 [cascading_failure_01_dx_005], the team explicitly notes:  \n     > \"Audit ingest lag increased after enabling additional token rotation telemetry; reduced by scaling audit workers and increasing batch flush interval.\"  \n     This confirms a **recent change** (telemetry addition) directly impacted the audit pipeline.\n   - On 2026-01-07 [cascading_failure_01_dx_006], connection pool **exhaustion=2** on `pool-idp-api-01` and **exhaustion=1** on `pool-idp-api-02` is observed, confirming resource starvation.\n   - Alerts on 2026-01-07 flag **[SEVERE] idp-api-01: CPU 57%** and **[SEVERE] idp-api-02: CPU 53%**, further indicating system stress.\n\n4. **Recovery and Validation:**\n   - After scaling audit workers and tuning batch flush intervals, on 2026-01-08 [cascading_failure_01_dx_007], `/audit_pipeline` ingest lag drops to **9.1 sec p95**, and `/token_ops` rotation failures decrease to **24**, showing improvement post-intervention.\n   - On 2026-01-09 [cascading_failure_01_dx_008], `/audit_pipeline` p50 latency returns to **3.2ms**, and SAML errors drop to **12**, indicating stabilization after mitigation.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe pattern of **increased audit pipeline latency**, **connection pool contention**, **CPU/memory pressure on IDP and audit components**, and **operational responses targeting audit worker scaling and batch tuning** provide strong, multi-source evidence that the root cause lies in **audit pipeline backpressure due to increased telemetry load**, which cascaded into authentication service degradation.\n\nTherefore, **yes**, there is sufficient evidence to begin a formal root cause investigation focused on **audit pipeline scalability and its impact on core authentication services**, with [cascading_failure_01_dx_003] through [cascading_failure_01_dx_006] being the critical entries documenting the onset and response.",

Furthermore, the authentication service (/auth) shows even lower error rates:\n- On 2024-01-15: /auth had 0.04% error rate (61 errors) out of 152,300 requests [cascading_failure_01_ep_001].\n- On 2024-01-16: /auth had 0.05% error rate (72 errors) out of 158,900 requests [cascading_failure_01_ep_002].\n- On 2024-01-17: /auth had 0.04% error rate (65 errors) out of 155,400 requests [cascading_failure_01_ep_003].\n\nThe SSO-related logs ([cascading_failure_01_dx_001] through [cascading_failure_01_dx_008]) pertain to a separate identity platform (e.g., /sso_sessions, /token_ops) and show isolated SAML assertion errors and token rotation issues, but these are not correlated in time or impact with the checkout service. For example:\n- SAML assertion errors are reported on 2026-01-04 ([cascading_failure_01_dx_003]), 2026-01-06 ([cascading_failure_01_dx_005]), and 2026-01-09 ([cascading_failure_01_dx_008]), but these dates do not align with any checkout degradation.\n- The /auth endpoint in the e-commerce system remains stable during these periods.\n\nAdditionally, connection pools for critical services (e.g., primary, replica) show no exhaustion or waiting requests [cascading_failure_01_ep_001\u2013003], and infrastructure metrics (CPU, memory) are within normal ranges.\n\nTherefore, based on the logs, authentication and SSO systems are operating within expected parameters and are not contributing to any checkout issues.

The only scheduled storage-related activity was a **routine cleanup** of the metrics database, which did not coincide with notable latency increases. Observed"
