Although the cleanup job ran on 2024-01-16 [cascading_failure_01_ep_002], the disk usage rebounded quickly, suggesting either:\n   - Inadequate cleanup scope\n   - Growing data ingestion outpacing retention controls\n   - Risk of future exhaustion if unaddressed\n\n2. **No Connection Pool Exhaustion or Latency Spikes:**\n   - All connection pools (`primary`, `replica`, `third_party_geo`) show **0 waiting**, **0 exhaustion**, and stable `avg_wait` times across all entries [cascading_failure_01_ep_001 to _004]\n   - This indicates database access is not currently bottlenecked.\n\n3. **Endpoint Performance Remains Stable:**\n   - All endpoints show consistent latency (p50, p95, p99) and error rates across the four days.\n   - For example, `/checkout` error rate fluctuates between **0.12%\u20130.13%** [cascading_failure_01_ep_001, _002, _004], which is stable.\n   - No new alerts related to service errors, timeouts, or latency thresholds.\n\n4. **Infrastructure Metrics Are Within Normal Ranges:**\n   - CPU, memory, and network usage on all nodes remain stable and well below saturation.\n   - Gateways and services show proportional increases in traffic and resource use, but no anomalies.\n\n5. **Operational Tickets Indicate Ongoing Awareness:**\n   - DISK-4421 (cleanup) on 2024-01-15 [cascading_failure_01_ep_001]\n   - DISK-4450 (retention) on 2024-01-16 [cascading_failure_01_ep_002]\n   - These recurring tickets suggest the team is actively managing the disk issue, but it has not been resolved.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile **no service outages or performance degradations** are evident, the **repeated disk usage warnings on `metrics-db-01`** [cascading_failure_01_ep_001, _002, _004] represent a **concerning operational pattern**. The fact that disk usage remains high despite a scheduled cleanup indicates a potential risk for future capacity exhaustion, which could lead to write failures or cascading issues if not addressed proactively.\n\nTherefore, **the primary concern is the sustained high disk utilization on `metrics-db-01`**, which should be escalated or investigated for long-term resolution (e.g., retention policy adjustment, storage expansion, or data archiving).",

The scheduled cleanup on 2024-01-16 did not prevent disk usage from rising again.\n2.

Therefore, **the severity of service degradation is assessed as negligible or non-existent**.\n\n### Key Observations Supporting This Assessment:\n\n1. **Endpoint Performance Metrics Are Stable**  \n   All endpoints show consistent latency and error rates across the four days. For example:\n   - `/checkout` error rate fluctuates between **0.12% and 0.13%** ([cascading_failure_01_ep_001], [cascading_failure_01_ep_002], [cascading_failure_01_ep_004]), with p99 latency varying within a narrow band (318\u2013330ms), indicating no meaningful regression.\n   - `/auth`, one of the most critical services, maintains sub-110ms p99 and error rates \u22640.05% throughout ([cascading_failure_01_ep_001] to [cascading_failure_01_ep_004]).\n   - No endpoint reports error rates exceeding 0.13%, and success rates remain \u226599.87% across all services.\n\n2. **Infrastructure Resources Are Within Normal Operating Ranges**  \n   - CPU and memory usage on all nodes (e.g., `gateway-01`, `service-b-01`, `metrics-db-01`) remain stable and well below capacity thresholds (e.g., CPU \u226436%, Mem \u226467%) ([cascading_failure_01_ep_001] to [cascading_failure_01_ep_004]).\n   - Connection pools show **no exhaustion or queuing** (waiting = 0, avg_wait \u22643ms) across all entries, indicating healthy database connectivity.\n\n3. **CDN and Caching Performance Is Consistent**  \n   - CDN hit rate remains steady at **~94%** (94.1% \u2192 94.3% \u2192 94.0% \u2192 94.2%) with origin requests scaling proportionally to traffic ([cascading_failure_01_ep_001] to [cascading_failure_01_ep_004]).\n   - Bandwidth increases slightly (6.2 \u2192 6.6 Gbps), reflecting normal traffic growth, not degradation.\n\n4. **Operational Alerts Are Non-Critical**  \n   - The recurring `[WARNING] DISK-USAGE-WARN` on `metrics-db-01` (disk_pct=78 \u2192 82 \u2192 79 \u2192 80) indicates a **gradual increase**, but no action has been triggered, and CPU/Mem remain stable. This suggests the system is still operating within safe limits.\n   - Other alerts are informational: certificate expiry warnings, log rotation, clock skew (180ms on gateway-02, corrected via NTP sync) \u2014 none indicate service impact.\n\n5. **No Incidents or Pages Reported**  \n   - On-call engineers report **0 pages** each day and note \"Quiet shift\" or \"Status: OK\" ([cascading_failure_01_ep_001], [cascading_failure_01_ep_003], [cascading_failure_01_ep_004]).\n   - Deployments (e.g., product-catalog v5.8.0, search-service v4.1.2, recommendations v1.9.0) show no associated performance anomalies.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile disk usage on `metrics-db-01` is trending upward and warrants monitoring, **no service-level degradation is evident** in latency, error rates, availability, or resource saturation. All systems are operating within expected parameters.\n\n**Severity of service degradation: None (Low risk, no current impact).**  \nOngoing disk growth should be addressed proactively, but it does not constitute service degradation at this time.",
