No subject-level abnormalities are reported, and aggregate means and medians do not approach clinically significant thresholds.\n\n2. **Trends in liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP, bilirubin)** show either stability or mild improvement:\n   - In the **statin subgroup** [clinical_signal_03_ep_002], ALT mean increased slightly from 25.5 to 26.8 U/L (still well below ULN of ~40\u201360 U/L), but AST mean **decreased** from 26.4 to 22.1 U/L, and ALP mean decreased from 84.9 to 71.0 U/L.\n   - In the **non-statin subgroup** [clinical_signal_03_ep_002], ALT mean remained stable (29.9 \u2192 29.7 U/L), AST mean decreased from 26.4 to 20.7 U/L, and ALP mean decreased from 71.9 to 56.7 U/L.\n   - Bilirubin increased slightly in the non-statin group (mean 0.73 \u2192 0.9 mg/dL), but remains within normal limits and is not accompanied by concurrent rises in transaminases or ALP, making a signal unlikely.\n\n3. **Renal function markers (creatinine, BUN)** show mild improvement:\n   - Statin subgroup creatinine mean decreased from 1.06 to 0.85 mg/dL [clinical_signal_03_ep_001 \u2192 clinical_signal_03_ep_002].\n   - Non-statin subgroup creatinine mean decreased from 1.1 to 0.92 mg/dL.\n   - These changes suggest better renal profiles rather than deterioration.\n\n4. **Hematologic parameters (WBC, platelets)** show no concerning trends:\n   - WBC mean increased in both groups (e.g., statin: 5.9 \u2192 7.5 K), but values remain within normal range and may reflect normal variation or minor infections (e.g., upper respiratory infections reported).\n   - Platelet counts are stable and within normal limits.\n\n5. **Adverse events remain mild (Grade 1), resolved, and mostly gastrointestinal**, with no pattern suggesting organ toxicity [AE-0001 to AE-0007]. No new serious adverse events (SAEs) or lab-based AEs (e.g., hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity) are reported.\n\n6. **No protocol deviations involve lab abnormalities or safety findings** [PD-001 to PD-006]; deviations are logistical or administrative.\n\nIn summary, despite enrollment increasing from 40 to 60 subjects, **lab parameters show stability or improvement**, with no consistent or clinically meaningful shifts suggesting an emerging safety signal [clinical_signal_03_ep_001, clinical_signal_03_ep_002].

However, the **statin concomitant subgroup** is disproportionately represented in the AE reports, experiencing all of the possibly related gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms (nausea, diarrhea, headache).

By [clinical_signal_03_ep_002], the statin subgroup ALT increased slightly (mean 26.8, median 26.3), while the non-statin subgroup ALT remained stable (mean 29.7, median 28.0). Notably, AST levels decreased in both subgroups: statin AST mean dropped from 26.4 to 22.1 U/L and non-statin from 26.4 to 20.7 U/L. Bilirubin increased slightly in the non-statin group (mean from 0.73 to 0.9 mg/dL), but remained within normal clinical ranges.\n\nThese lab changes are not indicative of a significant hepatic signal. The ALT elevations remain well below thresholds typically triggering concern (e.g., >3\u00d7 upper limit of normal), and AST is actually improving. Bilirubin changes are modest and not accompanied by concurrent ALT/AST elevations suggestive of hepatocellular injury or cholestasis.

There is no evidence of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) based on current data. No urgent protocol intervention is required. However, ongoing monitoring of liver enzymes\u2014particularly ALT in the statin subgroup\u2014is recommended.

In fact, AST and ALT in the statin group either remain stable or decline slightly from baseline to follow-up.\n\nTherefore, based on the available data in [clinical_signal_03_ep_001] and [clinical_signal_03_ep_002], **liver enzymes are not elevated in any concerning or clinically significant manner in any subset of participants**.

The ALT values in the statin subgroup are **lower than non-statin**, **stable over time**, and derived from **broadly distributed sites**, with **no indication of outlier values or site-specific anomalies**.

However, by [clinical_signal_03_ep_002], there is a notable shift:  \n- The **statin subgroup** shows a decrease in AST (from mean 26.4 to 22.1 U/L) and ALP (from 84.9 to 71.0 U/L), while ALT increases slightly (25.5 to 26.8 U/L).  \n- The **non-statin subgroup** also shows reductions in AST (26.4 to 20.7 U/L) and ALP (71.9 to 56.7 U/L), but an increase in bilirubin (mean 0.73 to 0.9 mg/dL), which may suggest early signs of altered hepatic function in this group.\n\nImportantly, the statin subgroup consistently has **fewer subjects (N=53)** compared to the non-statin group (N=131 initially, then 122), yet the number of patients on statins across sites increased from 2 in [clinical_signal_03_ep_001] (Sites 01 and 07) to **all 12 sites reporting statin concomitant use by [clinical_signal_03_ep_002]**.
