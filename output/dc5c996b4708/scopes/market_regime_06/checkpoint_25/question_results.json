      "answer_text": "The systematic strategy losses and portfolio drawdowns are primarily driven by a sustained market regime characterized by rising interest rates, widening credit spreads, and increasing market volatility. Key factors include:\n\n- **Rising Treasury yields**: The 2-year UST yield increased from 4.08% on October 9 to 4.50% on October 21, while the 10-year yield rose from 4.27% to 4.75% over the same period [market_regime_06_ep_009] [market_regime_06_ep_021]. This persistent upward pressure on rates negatively impacts duration-sensitive strategies.\n\n- **Deteriorating credit conditions**: Investment Grade (IG) spreads widened from 94 bps to 130 bps, and High Yield (HY) spreads expanded from 342 bps to 438 bps between October 9 and October 21, indicating growing risk aversion and credit stress [market_regime_06_ep_009] [market_regime_06_ep_021].\n\n- **Elevated equity volatility**: The VIX rose from 17.24 on October 9 to 27.88 on October 21, reflecting heightened market uncertainty and risk-off behavior, which challenges momentum and trend-following strategies [market_regime_06_ep_009] [market_regime_06_ep_021].\n\n- **Consistent equity market declines**: The S&P 500 (SPX) declined over multiple sessions, dropping from 5842.1 to 5602.6 between October 9 and October 21, with particularly sharp drawdowns on October 15 (\u22120.9%) and October 18 (\u22120.57%) [market_regime_06_ep_009] [market_regime_06_ep_015] [market_regime_06_ep_018].\n\nThese macro conditions collectively created adverse environments for systematic strategies, especially those reliant on stable volatility, low rates, or credit stability.",

      "answer_text": "If portfolio losses were driven by a tech sector selloff rather than a broad correlation regime change, we would expect non-tech asset classes to remain relatively stable or even decouple \u2014 showing resilience or positive performance as capital rotates out of tech. In particular, fixed income markets would likely show modest or neutral moves, credit spreads (especially investment grade) would not widen dramatically, and the U.S. dollar (DXY) might strengthen slightly due to safe-haven flows or rate differentials, but not sharply.\n\nHowever, the data does not support this pattern. Instead, we observe broad-based stress across asset classes:\n\n- Fixed income markets show consistent yield increases across maturities (2Y, 10Y, 30Y), indicating rising rates and sell-offs in bonds [market_regime_06_ep_017]. UST yields rose steadily from October 14 to October 17, with 10Y yields increasing from 4.42% to 4.58% [market_regime_06_ep_014, market_regime_06_ep_017].\n- Credit spreads widened notably: IG spreads increased from 103 bps to 114 bps and HY spreads from 364 bps to 392 bps over the same period, signaling growing credit risk aversion beyond equities [market_regime_06_ep_014, market_regime_06_ep_017].\n- The VIX rose from 19.88 to 23.62 between October 14 and October 17, reflecting broad market volatility, not just tech-specific turmoil [market_regime_06_ep_014, market_regime_06_ep_017].\n- The DXY increased from approximately 106.2 to 106.8, suggesting dollar strength possibly tied to risk-off behavior rather than isolated sector rotation [market_regime_06_ep_014, market_regime_06_ep_017].\n\nThis broad deterioration across fixed income, credit, volatility, and FX suggests a systemic risk-off move rather than a sector-specific tech selloff. Therefore, the observed pattern does not match what would be expected from a tech-driven drawdown and instead points to a broader correlation regime shift or macro-driven risk aversion [market_regime_06_ep_014, market_regime_06_ep_015, market_regime_06_ep_017].",

          "content": "If portfolio losses were driven by a tech sector selloff rather than a broad correlation regime change, we would expect non-tech asset classes to remain relatively stable or even decouple \u2014 showing resilience or positive performance as capital rotates out of tech. In particular, fixed income markets would likely show modest or neutral moves, credit spreads (especially investment grade) would not widen dramatically, and the U.S. dollar (DXY) might strengthen slightly due to safe-haven flows or rate differentials, but not sharply.\n\nHowever, the data does not support this pattern. Instead, we observe broad-based stress across asset classes:\n\n- Fixed income markets show consistent yield increases across maturities (2Y, 10Y, 30Y), indicating rising rates and sell-offs in bonds [market_regime_06_ep_017]. UST yields rose steadily from October 14 to October 17, with 10Y yields increasing from 4.42% to 4.58% [market_regime_06_ep_014, market_regime_06_ep_017].\n- Credit spreads widened notably: IG spreads increased from 103 bps to 114 bps and HY spreads from 364 bps to 392 bps over the same period, signaling growing credit risk aversion beyond equities [market_regime_06_ep_014, market_regime_06_ep_017].\n- The VIX rose from 19.88 to 23.62 between October 14 and October 17, reflecting broad market volatility, not just tech-specific turmoil [market_regime_06_ep_014, market_regime_06_ep_017].\n- The DXY increased from approximately 106.2 to 106.8, suggesting dollar strength possibly tied to risk-off behavior rather than isolated sector rotation [market_regime_06_ep_014, market_regime_06_ep_017].\n\nThis broad deterioration across fixed income, credit, volatility, and FX suggests a systemic risk-off move rather than a sector-specific tech selloff. Therefore, the observed pattern does not match what would be expected from a tech-driven drawdown and instead points to a broader correlation regime shift or macro-driven risk aversion [market_regime_06_ep_014, market_regime_06_ep_015, market_regime_06_ep_017].",

For example, on 2024-10-17, the SPX dropped by 0.48%, the VIX rose to 23.62 (+6.68%), and HY spreads increased to 392 bps, indicating rising risk aversion [market_regime_06_ep_017].\n\nHowever, the search results do not explicitly link these movements to cryptocurrency market volatility. There is no mention of cryptocurrency price swings, market reactions to crypto-specific events, or cross-market correlation analyses involving digital assets. Therefore, while traditional asset classes show signs of stress and volatility, the evidence does not confirm whether cryptocurrency market volatility is a contributing factor or source of contagion.\n\nThus, based on the available information, it cannot be determined whether cryptocurrency market volatility is causing contagion into traditional asset classes [market_regime_06_ep_004], [market_regime_06_ep_002], [market_regime_06_ep_013].",
