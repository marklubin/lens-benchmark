scenario:
  setting: 'A mid-cap industrial equipment manufacturer (FY revenue ~$800M).

    Monthly controller packages include: revenue by channel, AR aging

    (current/30/60/90/120+ days), DSO calculation, gross margin by

    product line, cash flow from operations, and internal auditor

    footnotes. The CFO is progressively manipulating revenue recognition

    through channel stuffing, bill-and-hold arrangements, and eventually

    round-tripping with a distributor. Financial ratios drift before

    the fraud becomes overt.

    '
  voice: 'Formal corporate finance style. Tables with dollar amounts and

    percentages. Terse footnotes. Auditor margin notes use standard

    accounting language. No narrative prose — numbers, ratios, and

    short annotations only.

  prompt: Based on the financial reports so far, are there any trends in receivables or cash flow that warrant attention?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: Accounts receivable aging is shifting away from current — the 60+ day buckets are growing. DSO has crept
      upward. Cash from operations is not keeping pace with reported revenue growth.

  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: Revenue recognition manipulation through channel stuffing, bill-and-hold arrangements, and round-trip

  prompt: Is there evidence of inventory fraud or phantom inventory in the financial data?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: No. Inventory accounting shows no phantom inventory or valuation manipulation. The issue is revenue
      recognition — bill-and-hold arrangements and AR aging deterioration, not inventory fraud.

  prompt: When did accounts receivable aging first show deterioration, and how has the 90+ days bucket trended?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: AR aging began deteriorating during the early signal phase as revenue acceleration outpaced collections.
      The 90+ day bucket grew steadily from a healthy baseline to a significant portion of total receivables over the escalation
      period.

  prompt: If the Q4 revenue patterns were purely seasonal (as management claims), what would you expect to see in Q1? Does
    the data support that?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: If the revenue spike were seasonal, you would expect Q1 normalization — AR aging reverting to baseline,
      DSO declining, and cash collections catching up. Instead, AR continues to age, DSO keeps rising, and the cash-revenue
      gap persists, indicating structural manipulation rather than seasonal patterns.

      trends, there is insufficient data to evaluate revenue recognition quality.

  prompt: What do the current financial ratios suggest about the company's revenue and cash flow health?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: The data suggests revenue recognition manipulation. Revenue is climbing but cash collections are flat,
      DSO is extended to 65-75 days, and the 90+ day AR bucket is growing rapidly. Bill-and-hold arrangements are appearing.
      The seasonal sales push explanation does not account for these structural trends.

  ground_truth:

      arrangements suggest premature revenue recognition. These are indicators of potential financial statement fraud requiring
      immediate investigation.

  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: DSO has accelerated from a healthy 42-45 day baseline to 65-75 days over the signal and escalation periods.
      The deterioration rate increased as channel stuffing and bill-and-hold arrangements expanded.

  prompt: If the revenue growth were driven by genuine new customer acquisition, what financial patterns would you expect?
    Does the data match?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: Genuine customer growth would show proportional increases in cash collections, stable or improving AR
      aging, and consistent DSO. Instead, collections lag revenue, AR is aging rapidly, and DSO is spiking — indicating the
      revenue is being recognized prematurely rather than earned from real demand.
