scenario:
  setting: 'A multi-strategy hedge fund''s daily trading desk briefing.

    Reports cover: equity indices (SPX, NDX, RTY), fixed income

    (UST 2Y/10Y/30Y yields, credit spreads IG/HY), FX (DXY,

    EUR/USD, USD/JPY), commodities (WTI, gold), volatility

    (VIX, MOVE index), cross-asset correlation matrices,

    fund flow data (ETF flows, futures positioning), and macro

    releases (FOMC, CPI, NFP, PMI). A central bank policy shift

    (surprise hawkish pivot) causes the equity-bond correlation

    to flip from negative to positive, breaking risk parity and

    60/40 portfolio assumptions. Systematic strategy losses

    mount as hedges fail.

  type: longitudinal
  prompt: Based on the desk briefings so far, are there any shifts in cross-asset dynamics?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: The equity-bond correlation is drifting less negative, moving toward zero. UST and SPX are starting
      to co-move on some days. MOVE index and FX vol are expanding. These shifts suggest the traditional negative equity-bond
      correlation may be breaking down.

  prompt: What is causing the systematic strategy losses and portfolio drawdowns?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: A regime shift in equity-bond correlation from negative to positive, driven by a central bank hawkish
      policy pivot. Risk parity and 60/40 strategies are failing because bonds no longer hedge equity risk. The tech sector
      selloff was a red herring — the real issue is the cross-asset correlation breakdown affecting all diversified strategies.

  prompt: How should the fund adjust its portfolio and risk management framework?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: Reduce risk parity leverage given positive correlation regime. Add explicit correlation hedges (long
      gold, long vol). Stress test portfolios for sustained positive equity-bond correlation. Shift from static to dynamic
      correlation assumptions in risk models.

  prompt: Is there evidence of a credit market liquidity crisis in the data?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: No. Credit spreads are widening but orderly. Credit market liquidity stress is not the primary driver.
      The primary signal is an equity-bond correlation regime shift driven by monetary policy.

  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: A regime shift in equity-bond correlation from negative to positive, driven by a central bank hawkish

  prompt: When did the equity-bond correlation first shift from negative toward positive, and over how many trading days did
    the transition occur?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: The equity-bond correlation began shifting during the early signal phase, moving from -0.35 to near
      zero before flipping positive during escalation. The transition occurred over approximately 10-15 trading days.

  prompt: If the portfolio losses were driven by a tech sector selloff rather than a correlation regime change, what pattern
    would you expect in non-tech asset classes? Does that match?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: A tech-specific selloff would leave bonds performing as a hedge (negative correlation preserved) and
      non-tech equities relatively stable. Instead, both equities and bonds are selling off simultaneously across all sectors.
      The positive correlation regime affects all diversified strategies, not just tech-heavy portfolios.

  prompt: Based on the first week of desk briefings, are there any notable shifts in market dynamics?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: No. Markets are operating within normal parameters. Equity-bond correlation is in the normal negative
      range, VIX is in the low teens, and cross-asset correlations are stable.

  prompt: Is there sufficient data to assess whether cross-asset correlation assumptions are holding?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: No. Five days of trading data is insufficient to evaluate correlation stability. Correlation regime
      changes typically emerge over weeks and require at least 20-30 days of rolling data for meaningful measurement.

  prompt: What is driving the portfolio drawdowns across systematic strategies?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: A regime shift in equity-bond correlation from negative to positive. Equities and bonds are selling
      off simultaneously, breaking risk parity and 60/40 portfolio assumptions. The MOVE index is elevated and the tech selloff
      narrative is a red herring masking the broader cross-asset correlation breakdown.

  prompt: How would you assess the risk to the fund's portfolio given current market dynamics?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: High risk. The equity-bond correlation flip is structural (driven by monetary policy), not transient.
      Risk parity funds are forced to deleverage, creating feedback loops. The fund's hedging assumptions are broken and max
      drawdowns on systematic strategies are likely to continue until positioning adjusts.

  prompt: Is there evidence of a physical commodity supply disruption affecting portfolio returns?

  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: The correlation moved from its baseline negative range (-0.35) through zero to positive territory (+0.15
      to +0.30) over approximately 10-12 trading days during the early signal and escalation phases. The transition accelerated

  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: The MOVE index began rising from its baseline range (around 95) during the early signal phase, creeping

  prompt: If the market stress were caused by a sudden liquidity crisis, what pattern would you expect in cross-asset correlations?
    Does the data match?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: A liquidity crisis would show all correlations spiking toward 1.0 simultaneously with credit market
      freeze. Instead, the correlation shift is primarily in equity-bond (from negative to positive), credit spreads are widening
      but orderly, and the pattern emerged gradually. This is a regime change, not a liquidity event.

  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: The evidence is suggestive but not conclusive. The rolling correlation has moved from -0.35 to near
      zero over several days, which is unusual. However, short-term correlation drift can occur in normal markets. Another
      week of co-movement data would strengthen the case for a true regime shift.
