The record indicates a critical alert for the checkout endpoint with an error percentage of 0.82, which is significant enough to warrant investigation. Additionally, there is a warning alert related to connection pool waiting on the primary connection pool, with 18 waiting connections and an average wait time of 18 ms. These metrics suggest potential issues that could be impacting service performance and reliability."

The record indicates a critical alert for the checkout service due to an error percentage of 0.71, which is significant enough to warrant investigation. Additionally, there are multiple events related to the checkout service, including a rollback of service-C and updates to gateway circuit breaker settings, suggesting ongoing issues that require further analysis."
