  prompt: When did ALT elevations first become apparent, and how many weeks elapsed before subjects met Hy's Law criteria?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: ALT elevations in the statin subgroup first became apparent during the early signal phase. It took approximately
      7-13 weeks from initial detection to subjects meeting Hy's Law criteria (ALT >3x ULN + bilirubin >2x ULN) during the
      escalation phase.

  prompt: If the Site 07 lab equipment calibration issue were responsible for the ALT elevations, what pattern would you expect
    across sites? Does that match the data?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: If Site 07 equipment were the cause, ALT elevations would be confined to Site 07 and resolve after recalibration.
      Instead, the ALT signal appears across multiple sites and correlates with statin co-administration, not site. The cross-site
      pattern rules out a site-specific equipment explanation.

      small and exposure duration too short to draw conclusions about the drug's safety profile.

  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: Hepatotoxicity in the statin co-administered subgroup. ALT elevations reaching 2-3x ULN across multiple
      sites, with two subjects meeting Hy's Law criteria. Non-statin patients remain stable. The cross-site distribution rules
      out the Site 07 equipment hypothesis.

      recognized indicator of potential drug-induced liver injury. The signal is escalating and protocol amendment is urgent
      to prevent further SAEs.

  ground_truth:

  prompt: Are there musculoskeletal or pain-related adverse events associated with LNS-4821?

  prompt: If the ALT elevations were caused by a viral hepatitis outbreak among trial subjects, what pattern would you expect?
    Does the data match?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: Viral hepatitis would show clustered onset at specific sites, associated symptoms (fatigue, jaundice),
      and positive viral serologies. Instead, the elevations are distributed across sites and correlate with statin co-administration,
      not geography or viral exposure. The pattern is consistent with a pharmacokinetic interaction, not infection.
