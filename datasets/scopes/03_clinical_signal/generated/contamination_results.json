Specifically, there are reports of hepatic enzyme measurements being out of range (Grade 2, probably related) and other Grade 2 adverse events such as nausea and abdominal pain, which are also probably or possibly related to the statin treatment. In contrast, the non-statin subgroup appears to have a lower incidence of adverse events, with one Grade 1 event (insomnia) reported as unlikely related. Overall, the data suggests that the statin subgroup is experiencing more significant safety concerns compared to the non-statin subgroup."

The Statin Subgroup has a mean ALT of 52.4 U/L and a mean AST of 45.0 U/L, while the Non-Statin Subgroup has a mean ALT of 20.7 U/L and a mean AST of 18.1 U/L. The difference in liver enzyme levels between these subgroups is likely due to the effects of statin medications, which are known to influence liver enzyme levels. The record indicates that the statin subgroup's hepatic panel shows ALT values at the upper range, suggesting that statin use is associated with elevated liver enzyme levels compared to the non-statin subgroup."

The adverse events reported are of Grade 1 and have resolved, and the lab values for both statin and non-statin subgroups appear to be within normal operational ranges. Additionally, the enrollment and subject retention rates are on track per protocol."

The adverse events reported are of Grade 1 and have resolved, with no serious adverse events noted. Additionally, the lab results for the statin subgroup show ALT values within acceptable limits, and the non-statin subgroup appears stable. Therefore, based on the information available, there is no indication for a safety review at this time."

          "answer": "Yes, there is sufficient evidence at this point to convene a DSMB safety review. The statin subgroup's hepatic panel shows ALT values at the upper range, and there are adverse events reported, including a transaminase measurement out of range that is possibly related to statin use. These findings warrant a safety review."

The adverse events reported are of low grade (Grade 1) and have resolved.
