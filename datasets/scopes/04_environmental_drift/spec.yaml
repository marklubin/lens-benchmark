    Compliance flags against EPA MCL thresholds. An unpermitted

    industrial discharge between stations WQ-02 and WQ-03 is

    releasing hexavalent chromium. The concentration gradient

  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: No. Agricultural nutrient levels (nitrates, phosphorus) are within expected background ranges. The contamination
      signal is hexavalent chromium from a point source, not agricultural runoff.

    stable or changing?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: Chromium levels at WQ-03 first exceeded background during the early signal phase. The concentration
      has been progressively increasing, from 12-18 ug/L initially to 40-65 ug/L during escalation, indicating an ongoing
      or worsening discharge.

  prompt: If agricultural runoff were causing the elevated chromium readings, what spatial pattern would you expect across
    monitoring stations? Does that match the data?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: Agricultural runoff would produce diffuse contamination across multiple stations with gradual onset
      correlated with rainfall and growing season. Instead, the data shows a sharp point-source pattern — upstream stations
      are clean, WQ-03 shows peak concentration, and downstream stations show progressive dilution. Agricultural activity
      explains turbidity spikes but not the chromium gradient.

  ground_truth:

      appears to be actively discharging. Downstream communities and ecosystems are at risk. Immediate investigation and potential

    canonical_answer: Chromium at WQ-03 has risen from background (<5 ug/L) through initial elevation (12-18 ug/L) to concerning
      levels (40-65 ug/L) during the escalation phase. The rate of increase has been roughly doubling every few reporting

  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: Chromium at WQ-03 first diverged from upstream stations during the early signal phase, approximately

  prompt: If the chromium elevation were caused by natural geological weathering, what pattern would you expect? Does the
    data match?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: Geological weathering would produce gradual, diffuse chromium elevation across all stations with no
      sharp spatial gradient. Instead, the data shows a stark point-source pattern with upstream stations clean and peak concentration
      at WQ-03. This rules out natural weathering.
