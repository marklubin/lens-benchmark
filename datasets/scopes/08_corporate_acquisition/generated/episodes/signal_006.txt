NEXTERA SOLUTIONS, INC.
MINUTES OF SPECIAL MEETING OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
January 21, 2025

A special meeting of the Board of Directors of Nextera Solutions, Inc. was held on Tuesday, January 21, 2025, via secure video conference. The meeting commenced at 2:00 PM Pacific Standard Time.

DIRECTORS PRESENT:
- Robert Kessler, Board Chair
- Sarah Jiang, Board Member
- Tom Whitfield, Board Member
- Nina Patel, Board Member
- David Aldric, CEO (ex officio)

ALSO PRESENT:
- Maria Fuentes, Corporate Secretary

Board convened special session with all five members present. The Corporate Secretary confirmed a quorum was present and the meeting was called to order by Mr. Kessler at 2:02 PM PST. The meeting was held via secure video conference, not at HQ, at the direction of the Board Chair. No external advisors were present at this session. Total meeting duration: one hour and forty-eight minutes.

AGENDA ITEM 1 — CALL TO ORDER AND APPROVAL OF AGENDA

Mr. Kessler called the meeting to order and presented the agenda for approval. Mr. Whitfield moved to approve the agenda as distributed. Ms. Patel seconded. The agenda was approved unanimously. The Corporate Secretary noted that a revised agenda had been distributed the prior evening reflecting the addition of a new item under agenda item 7, labeled Strategic Exploration.

AGENDA ITEM 2 — MINUTES OF PRIOR MEETING

The minutes of the regular December 2024 Board meeting, previously distributed to all directors on January 14, were presented for approval. Ms. Jiang moved to approve the minutes as written. Mr. Whitfield seconded. The minutes were approved unanimously without amendment. The Corporate Secretary confirmed that executed copies had been filed in the company's corporate records.

AGENDA ITEM 3 — Q1 FORECAST REVIEW AND STANDARD FINANCIAL UPDATE

Kessler opened with the standard financial update and Q1 forecast review. The CFO had prepared written materials in advance, which had been distributed to all directors on January 17 via the board portal. Mr. Kessler summarized the key points from the financial package: revenue tracking above plan across all customer segments, the bookings pipeline showing strength entering the new fiscal quarter with several large enterprise deals expected to close in February, and operating expenses within budget for the quarter. Cash reserves remained healthy.

The Board reviewed the materials at length. Ms. Patel asked several clarifying questions regarding the timing of certain large enterprise deal closings expected in Q1, specifically the pipeline concentration in two accounts that together represented approximately eighteen percent of the quarter's bookings target. Mr. Kessler acknowledged the concentration risk and noted that the CFO had provided a sensitivity analysis in the appendix materials.

Mr. Whitfield asked about headcount plan adherence. The materials showed that the company had ended Q4 with four hundred and six employees, slightly below the planned headcount of four hundred and twelve. Mr. Aldric noted that the remaining open positions were primarily in engineering and that recruiting was on track to fill them by the end of February.

Ms. Jiang asked about gross margin trends. The Q1 forecast showed gross margins holding steady at approximately seventy-eight percent, consistent with prior quarters. No action was required on this agenda item.

AGENDA ITEM 4 — PRODUCT ROADMAP UPDATE

Aldric presented the product roadmap update including Axion Labs evaluation status. The presentation covered three major workstreams for Q1 2025. First, the recommendation engine version 3 launch, which was tracking toward a February production deployment after completing integration testing. Second, the Kubernetes infrastructure migration, which the engineering team had been preparing since Q4. Third, the ongoing evaluation of Axion Labs as a potential data partnership candidate.

On the recommendation engine, Mr. Aldric noted that all integration tests were passing and performance benchmarks were scheduled to begin the following day. He described this as the most significant product upgrade in the past eighteen months and expected it to have a material positive impact on customer engagement metrics.

On the Kubernetes migration, Mr. Aldric summarized the load testing results: the platform had sustained three times peak traffic for two hours with maximum latency remaining within acceptable limits. The migration window was targeted for the first week of February.

On the Axion Labs evaluation, Mr. Aldric reported that the product team had completed approximately sixty percent of planned customer interviews, with early results showing strong demand for real-time logistics data. He noted that the evaluation was proceeding well and that a decision on the partnership was expected in the first week of February. The Board asked questions about the competitive implications and the resource commitment required for integration. Mr. Aldric estimated eight to twelve weeks of dedicated engineering time and described it as consistent with standard partnership integrations the company had undertaken in prior years.

Ms. Patel asked about the Axion Labs evaluation timeline and whether it could be accelerated. Mr. Aldric replied that the evaluation was already on an aggressive timeline. Ms. Jiang asked about the cost of the partnership. Mr. Aldric deferred to the product team's final analysis but noted the estimated range was between one hundred eighty thousand and two hundred fifty thousand dollars per year.

AGENDA ITEM 5 — COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE AND MARKET POSITIONING

Board discussed competitive landscape and market positioning at the request of Mr. Kessler. Mr. Aldric provided an overview of recent market developments in the supply chain analytics space. Two venture-backed competitors had raised significant rounds in Q4 2024: DataFreight had closed a Series C at eighty-five million dollars, and ChainVue had raised a Series B at forty million dollars. Additionally, a larger enterprise player, OracleSoft, had announced a supply chain analytics module that would be bundled with their existing ERP product.

The Board discussed the implications for Nextera's pricing strategy and market share trajectory at length. Mr. Whitfield asked whether any of the competitive developments changed the company's growth assumptions. Mr. Aldric said they did not, citing Nextera's customer retention rate of ninety-six percent and net revenue retention of one hundred and twelve percent as evidence that the company's competitive position remained strong. Ms. Patel concurred and noted that the Board had discussed similar competitive dynamics in prior quarters without material impact on company performance.

Mr. Kessler asked about the company's win rate in competitive evaluations. Mr. Aldric reported that the win rate against direct competitors had been approximately sixty-five percent in Q4, consistent with prior quarters. The win rate against the larger enterprise bundled solutions was approximately forty percent, though those deals typically had longer sales cycles and different buyer profiles. The Board discussed strategies for improving win rates in the enterprise segment.

AGENDA ITEM 6 — GOVERNANCE AND COMPLIANCE UPDATE

The Corporate Secretary provided a brief governance update. The annual directors and officers insurance renewal was being processed with the current carrier, Hartford Financial. The policy premium was increasing approximately seven percent year over year, consistent with broader market trends in the D&O insurance market. The current policy provided twenty-five million dollars in coverage with a fifty-thousand-dollar retention.

The Board's committee assignments for 2025 had been finalized and distributed. Ms. Patel would continue to chair the Audit Committee, Mr. Whitfield would continue to chair the Compensation Committee, and Ms. Jiang would chair the newly formed Technology Advisory Committee.

Ms. Fuentes also noted that the company's SOC 2 Type II audit was scheduled for March 3 through 21 and that the CISO's team had begun preparation work. The CISO had reported no material gaps in the preliminary readiness assessment. Mr. Kessler asked whether any issues were anticipated. Ms. Fuentes said the CISO had reported no material concerns, noting that the company had achieved a clean SOC 2 Type II report in the prior year and that no significant changes to the control environment had occurred since then.

The Corporate Secretary also reminded the Board that the annual Board effectiveness self-assessment was due by February 15. Questionnaires had been distributed via the board portal.

No action was required on this agenda item.

AGENDA ITEM 7 — STRATEGIC EXPLORATION: Mr. Aldric informed the Board of preliminary inbound interest from Meridian Corp regarding a potential strategic transaction. The Board discussed the matter.

Mr. Aldric provided background on Meridian Corp, describing it as an $8.2 billion enterprise software conglomerate listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Meridian Corp operates across four business segments: enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management, supply chain management, and business intelligence. They employ approximately twelve thousand people globally with headquarters in Boston, Massachusetts.

Mr. Aldric stated that the inbound interest had come through an introduction from a mutual contact and that the initial conversations had been preliminary in nature. He characterized the interest as exploratory and noted that no formal offer had been made, no term sheet had been exchanged, and no financial advisors had been retained by either party. The discussions to date had consisted of two phone calls between Mr. Aldric and a senior executive at Meridian.

Mr. Kessler asked about the nature of the interest. Mr. Aldric described it as a general expression of interest in a strategic transaction, without specifying whether Meridian was contemplating an acquisition, a partnership, a joint venture, or some other form of combination. Mr. Aldric recommended that the Board authorize him to continue exploratory discussions to better understand Meridian's intent and to assess whether further engagement would be in the best interests of the company and its stockholders.

Mr. Whitfield asked about Meridian's acquisition history. Mr. Aldric said Meridian had completed four acquisitions in the past three years, ranging from approximately one hundred fifty million to one point two billion dollars. Their most recent acquisition was in Q3 2024, when they acquired a business intelligence startup called DataPrism for approximately four hundred million dollars.

Ms. Patel asked whether Mr. Aldric had any preliminary view on valuation. Mr. Aldric said it was premature to discuss valuation given the early stage of conversations. Ms. Patel noted that the Board should establish guidelines for any further discussions to protect the company's interests and suggested that the company should retain independent legal counsel and a financial advisor before engaging in any substantive valuation discussions.

Mr. Kessler asked whether the company's existing outside counsel at Morrison & Partners had experience with transactions of this nature. The Corporate Secretary noted that Morrison & Partners had represented the company since incorporation but that their M&A practice was relatively small. Ms. Patel suggested that the company consider engaging a larger firm with dedicated M&A expertise if discussions progressed.

The Board debated the matter at length. The discussion under agenda item 7 lasted approximately thirty-five minutes.

Mr. Kessler expressed the view that it would be prudent to continue the conversations to understand the opportunity, characterizing it as a normal exercise of the Board's fiduciary responsibilities. Mr. Whitfield agreed, noting that the Board had a fiduciary duty to understand all options available to maximize stockholder value. He referenced Revlon duties and noted that while they were not currently in a sale process, the Board should be informed about the landscape.

Ms. Patel supported continuing the discussions but recommended that external legal counsel be retained before any substantive negotiations began. She also recommended that the Board establish a special committee if discussions progressed beyond the exploratory phase.

Ms. Jiang expressed opposition to continuing the discussions. Ms. Jiang: "I want my opposition recorded. I believe our best path is organic growth and I do not support exploring this."

Ms. Jiang stated that the company's growth trajectory was strong, that the team had executed well across every metric that mattered, and that exploring a transaction at this stage could be distracting and demoralizing for employees if word leaked. She noted that inbound interest from larger companies was a regular occurrence for successful growth-stage companies and that the Board should not feel obligated to engage with every expression of interest. She further noted that the company had received similar inbound interest on at least three prior occasions during her Board tenure and had declined to engage each time.

Mr. Whitfield responded that the prior instances had involved companies that were not strategic fits. He noted that Meridian's supply chain management division made this inquiry qualitatively different from prior inbound interest.

After further discussion, Mr. Kessler called for a vote on the following resolution:

RESOLVED: The Board authorizes the CEO to continue exploratory discussions regarding Project Lighthouse, with updates to be provided at each regular Board meeting. Vote: 4-1 (Jiang opposed).

Mr. Kessler noted that the codename "Project Lighthouse" would be used for all future Board communications regarding this matter. All materials related to Project Lighthouse would be marked Board Confidential and restricted to Board members, the CEO, and the General Counsel. No information regarding Project Lighthouse was to be shared with any other company employee, officer, or advisor without prior Board approval.

Ms. Fuentes confirmed that a separate secure folder had been created on the board portal for Project Lighthouse materials and that access had been restricted to the five directors and the CEO.

AGENDA ITEM 8 — OTHER BUSINESS

No other business was raised by any director. Mr. Kessler reminded the Board of the upcoming February regular meeting and noted that the agenda would include an update on Project Lighthouse as a standing item.

AGENDA ITEM 9 — ADJOURNMENT

There being no further business to come before the meeting, Mr. Kessler adjourned the meeting at 3:50 PM PST. The next update is scheduled for the February regular Board meeting.

Respectfully submitted,

Maria Fuentes
Corporate Secretary

@channel Sprint 2 is live. 12 stories, 280 points. Priority 1: rec engine v3 performance benchmarks. Priority 2: K8s prod migration prep.

Full breakdown in the sprint board. Team leads, please confirm story assignments by EOD. Sprint 2 runs January 20 through January 31.

[09:04 AM] jill.nakamura
confirmed for the search team stories. we're taking the three rec engine benchmarking stories plus the relevance tuning story that carried over from sprint 1.

[09:05 AM] ryan.kowalski
platform infra confirmed. 4 stories on our board, all K8s related. we've got the node pool configuration, the service mesh validation, the monitoring dashboard migration, and the rollback automation story.

[09:06 AM] elena.voronova
ML team confirmed. 2 stories — the recommendation model retraining pipeline and the feature store migration.

[09:07 AM] marcus.webb
:thumbsup: love the quick confirms. let's have a clean sprint. zero carryover this time.

[09:12 AM] sami.okoro
Quick update on rec engine v3: all 847 integration tests passing. Performance benchmarks start tomorrow. :white_check_mark:

We've also got 2,341 unit tests in the rec engine v3 suite, all green. The test suite takes about 22 minutes to run end-to-end, which is about 4 minutes longer than v2, but the coverage is substantially broader. The team has been crushing it.

[09:14 AM] marcus.webb
amazing work sami. 847 integration tests all green is no joke. that test suite is a safety net for everything that comes next. looking forward to the perf numbers.

[09:15 AM] lisa.chen.platform
Adding K8s migration context for anyone who missed last week's sync: we ran a load test at 3x peak traffic sustained for 2 hours. Max latency was 410ms. We're feeling good about the migration window.

[09:17 AM] dev.shankar
410ms at 3x peak? that's solid. what was the baseline at normal traffic?

[09:18 AM] lisa.chen.platform
baseline at 1x traffic: p50 at 45ms, p99 at 120ms. At 3x it went to p50 85ms, p99 410ms. The scaling behavior is linear up to about 2.5x then starts curving up, but still well within our SLA. We tested on a replica cluster with identical node configuration to prod.

[09:19 AM] dev.shankar
nice, thanks for the detail. did you test with the new ingress controller or the old one?

[09:20 AM] lisa.chen.platform
new ingress controller — NGINX Ingress 1.9.5. We also tested failover between availability zones. Failover completed in under 8 seconds in every test run. Total test runs: 14 over the past two weeks.

[09:22 AM] kevin.drummond
quick question on the sprint — are we still doing the Friday demo? last sprint we skipped it and I think we lost some visibility across teams on what people are building

[09:23 AM] marcus.webb
yes, Friday demos are back on. 3pm, main conference room or Zoom for remote. every team presents one thing. keep it to 5 minutes per team. I want to see working software, not slides.

[09:24 AM] kevin.drummond
:raised_hands: thank you. I'll sign up the frontend team for a demo of the new analytics dashboard refresh.

[09:28 AM] elena.voronova
I can demo the recommendation model A/B test framework. it's almost ready and it'll be relevant for the v3 launch.

[09:31 AM] sami.okoro
for the rec engine benchmarks, here's what we're measuring: throughput (queries/sec), p50/p95/p99 latency, memory utilization under sustained load, cold start time, and cache hit ratio at various warm-up intervals. We'll have numbers by Thursday.

[09:33 AM] lisa.chen.platform
@sami.okoro do you need us to spin up the isolated benchmark cluster or are you running on staging?

[09:34 AM] sami.okoro
isolated cluster please. I want clean numbers without staging crosstalk. something with 8 nodes matching prod spec. can you have it ready by tomorrow morning?

[09:35 AM] lisa.chen.platform
will do. I'll spin up an 8-node cluster in us-west-2 with the same instance types as prod — m6i.4xlarge. I'll ping you when it's up. Should be ready by 7am tomorrow.

[09:37 AM] sami.okoro
perfect. thanks lisa.

[09:41 AM] priya.mehta.frontend
unrelated but has anyone seen the new React 19 stable release? thinking about whether we should plan a migration for the dashboard this year

[09:42 AM] kevin.drummond
saw it. the compiler looks interesting and the server components model is maturing, but I wouldn't rush. let the ecosystem catch up. half our component libraries haven't released compatible versions yet.

[09:43 AM] priya.mehta.frontend
agreed, just want it on the radar for Q2 planning. the performance improvements in the concurrent rendering model could be big for our dashboard load times. currently we're at 3.2s for initial render on the main dashboard.

[09:45 AM] kevin.drummond
3.2s is rough, yeah. but we could also get wins from code splitting without a framework migration. let's add both to the proposals doc.

[09:48 AM] marcus.webb
Q2 planning is March. Add it to the proposals doc and we'll evaluate then. For now, stay focused on sprint 2 deliverables.

[09:55 AM] lisa.chen.platform
Also wanted to mention — engineering velocity trend is up 8% quarter over quarter. That's based on story points delivered, adjusted for team size. We're also tracking deployment frequency which is up from 4.2 deploys/week to 5.1 deploys/week. Good trajectory across the board.

[09:57 AM] marcus.webb
great metrics to see. I'll include them in the engineering update for the next all-hands. keep it up everyone.

[10:02 AM] dev.shankar
one more thing on K8s — we should probably run a chaos engineering session before the migration. inject some pod failures and see how the system recovers. I can set up a Chaos Monkey configuration if we have time.

[10:04 AM] lisa.chen.platform
love it. let's do it Wednesday afternoon. I'll set up a sandbox environment so we don't mess with the benchmark cluster.

[10:06 AM] dev.shankar
:thumbsup: will prep the failure injection scripts

[10:15 AM] sami.okoro
hackathon signup opens next week! 48 hours, February 7-8. Theme: 'supply chain intelligence for everyone'. Start forming teams!

Budget is $15K for prizes. Registration details going out via the #hackathon channel next week.

[10:16 AM] ryan.kowalski
oh man I've been waiting for this. already have an idea. who wants to build a natural language query layer for logistics data? think "what's the cheapest route from Shanghai to LA this month?" and get an actual answer with data.

[10:17 AM] jill.nakamura
count me in @ryan.kowalski. I can bring the search engine expertise.

[10:18 AM] dev.shankar
is there a prize pool this year?

[10:19 AM] sami.okoro
$15K in prizes. first place gets $7K, second gets $4K, third gets $2K, plus a $2K 'most creative' award. last year's winning project (the anomaly detection dashboard) actually made it into the product.

[10:20 AM] dev.shankar
:money_with_wings: say no more. I'm in.

[10:22 AM] kevin.drummond
can we do cross-functional teams? I want to pull in a designer and a PM to build something more polished

[10:23 AM] sami.okoro
yes, cross-functional is encouraged. Max team size is 5. You can pull from any department — engineering, product, design, data science, CS, whoever.

[10:25 AM] priya.mehta.frontend
I'm going to pitch a real-time shipment visualization. anyone interested in a frontend-heavy project? think WebGL-rendered globe with live tracking dots.

[10:26 AM] anna.kolesnikova
yes! I've been wanting to experiment with WebGL for map rendering. I prototyped something with Three.js last month that could render 50K data points at 60fps. let's do it.

[10:28 AM] priya.mehta.frontend
amazing. let's sync offline and plan it out. I'll set up a team channel.

[10:30 AM] marcus.webb
love the energy. hackathon details and registration form will be in the #hackathon channel next week. Sprint 2 first, hackathon second. Let's focus on this week's deliverables.

[10:45 AM] lisa.chen.platform
One more thing on the K8s migration — I've set up a dedicated war room channel: #k8s-migration. If you're involved in the migration, please join. Status updates will go there starting Jan 27. On-call rotation for the migration week will be posted there too.

[10:46 AM] marcus.webb
:thumbsup: thanks Lisa

[11:02 AM] sami.okoro
random thought but rec engine v3 unit test count (2,341) is more than double what v2 had. v2 had 1,089 unit tests. test coverage is at 94% now vs 81% for v2. :chart_with_upwards_trend:

[11:04 AM] jill.nakamura
we also have way better edge case coverage this time. the fuzzy matching tests alone are like 200 cases. and we added property-based testing for the scoring algorithm which found 3 bugs during development that our regular tests missed.

[11:06 AM] sami.okoro
yeah the property-based tests were huge. shoutout to @elena.voronova for pushing for those during the architecture review.

[11:07 AM] elena.voronova
:blush: just trying to make sure we don't ship regressions. the model inference path is where most of the edge cases live.

[11:15 AM] marcus.webb
end of morning standup thread. go build things. see you at Friday demo.

Subject: Enterprise QBR Schedule — Q1

Team,

I've finalized the Q1 QBR schedule for our top 20 enterprise accounts. These 20 accounts represent 44% of our ARR, so these meetings are the highest-priority activity for the CS org this quarter. I've attached the full schedule spreadsheet, but here's the summary:

QBR Schedule Overview:
- Total QBRs scheduled this quarter: 42 accounts
- Top 20 enterprise accounts: QBRs in January and February
- Remaining accounts: March
- Format: 90-minute sessions, executive sponsor + CSM + TAM
- Location: mix of on-site and virtual depending on customer preference

I need each of you to review the schedule for your accounts and confirm the following by EOD Wednesday:

1. All internal stakeholders are confirmed and calendar holds are in place
2. Customer executive sponsors have accepted calendar invites
3. QBR decks are in progress using the Q1 template in the shared drive
4. Any scheduling conflicts flagged immediately so we can reschedule

For context on where we stand heading into Q1:

Customer Health Dashboard (as of Jan 20):
- Green: 71% of accounts
- Yellow: 22% of accounts
- Red: 7% of accounts

Expansion Pipeline: $1.8M across 14 opportunities
Renewal Rate (Q4 actual): 96%
CSM-to-Account Ratio: 1:12

Our Q4 renewal rate was excellent at 96%, and I want to maintain that momentum into Q1. The yellow accounts are our primary focus this quarter — let's use the QBRs to surface issues early and get ahead of any churn risk. For the red accounts, I want dedicated save plans reviewed with me before the QBR.

Please also flag any accounts where we should adjust the meeting format. Some of the larger accounts may need a two-hour slot or a multi-day workshop format.

Best,
Amanda Briggs

Subject: RE: Enterprise QBR Schedule — Q1

Amanda,

A few updates from my portfolio:

1. Freight Corp: Great news — Freight Corp is back on track. Their VP Engineering personally called to apologize for the delays. Implementation now targeting Feb 14 go-live. I've already built the QBR deck incorporating lessons learned from the escalation. They acknowledged the delays were on their side — their internal platform team had been pulled onto another project in November and December, which stalled our integration work. They're now fully staffed again and the remaining tasks are on a two-week sprint to completion.

2. LogiFlow Inc: Great news: LogiFlow signed the expansion yesterday — $240K, 3-year term. That's our largest expansion deal this quarter. I'll update the pipeline tracker and get this into Salesforce today. The deal includes their new European operations, which adds twelve distribution centers to their Nextera instance. The QBR with LogiFlow will be a celebration — their COO has asked to discuss phase 2 planning already.

3. GlobalShip Partners: GlobalShip wants to discuss a 3-year renewal with volume pricing. Tomas, please set up the meeting. — Actually, Amanda, I know this was your note to me in the team meeting last week, and I've already reached out to their procurement team. We're looking at the first week of February for the initial discussion. They're interested in locking in pricing for the full three years, which is a great signal for us. Their current contract is $285K ARR and they've been on the platform for four years.

I'll have all QBR decks for my accounts ready by Friday. I'm covering eight accounts this quarter.

Best,
Tomas Lindgren

Tomas,

Outstanding work across the board. The LogiFlow expansion is a huge win — $240K on a 3-year term is exactly the kind of deal that moves the needle for the org. Please make sure that's entered in Salesforce by EOD so it hits the January bookings numbers. Also flag it for the finance team's January close — they'll want to recognize the booking this month.

On Freight Corp — glad it's back on track. Let's schedule a post-mortem for the escalation once they go live on Feb 14. I want to document what worked and what we'd do differently. That escalation playbook could help the whole team going forward. It's one of the cleaner recoveries we've managed.

On GlobalShip — yes, please set up the meeting. A 3-year renewal discussion is high priority. Loop me in on the initial call. We'll want to align internally on pricing thresholds before we go in — I'll have Jordan run the margin analysis for different discount tiers.

The rest of the team — please follow Tomas's lead on getting updates out early. I want a full status roll-up by Friday so I can prep for the executive review on Monday.

A few more data points for your QBR prep:

Retention Metrics for QBR Decks:
- Overall gross retention: 96% (Q4)
- Net revenue retention: 112% (Q4)
- Average time to value: 42 days (from contract signing to first dashboard live)
- Support CSAT: 4.6/5.0 (trailing 90-day average)
- Average support ticket resolution time: 4.2 hours (P1), 18 hours (P2)

Customer Segmentation (as of Jan 20):
- Enterprise (>$200K ARR): 18 accounts, $28.4M ARR
- Mid-Market ($50K-$200K): 47 accounts, $19.2M ARR
- Growth (<$50K): 112 accounts, $8.9M ARR
- Total ARR: approximately $56.5M across 177 active accounts

Use these numbers in your QBR decks where relevant. The net revenue retention at 112% is something we should highlight in every QBR — it demonstrates we're growing within accounts, not just retaining them.

Best,
Amanda

Team,

Adding a few updates from my portfolio:

1. TransPacific Shipping: QBR moved to Feb 5 per their request. Their CEO is joining, which is unusual — she typically sends the COO. I've expanded the deck to include a competitive analysis section they specifically asked for. They want to understand how our capabilities compare to two other vendors they're evaluating for a new module. I'll need input from the product team on the comparison.

2. Harbor Logistics Group: Requested a two-hour QBR slot instead of the standard 90 minutes. They want to discuss integration with their new TMS system, TrackPro 8.0, which they're deploying in March. I'm pulling in a solutions architect for this one. The integration scope could be significant — their current ARR is $195K and the TMS integration could unlock another $80-100K in expansion.

3. NordicFreight: Smooth sailing. Usage is up 34% QoQ, which is the highest growth rate in my portfolio. Expansion conversation planned for Q2 — they're interested in the predictive analytics module that's on the roadmap.

4. VerdeShip International: Stable account, $145K ARR, no concerns. QBR scheduled for Feb 12.

I have a scheduling conflict with the VerdeShip QBR on Feb 12 — I have a doctor's appointment that morning. Can someone cover or should I reschedule with the customer?

Grace,

Good updates. A CEO joining the QBR at TransPacific is noteworthy — make sure we have our best foot forward. Ask Tomas to review your deck before the meeting. For the competitive analysis, reach out to Hannah Choi's team — they maintain the competitive intelligence database.

On the VerdeShip conflict — reschedule with the customer. Don't have someone else cover your account. Continuity matters with our enterprise customers. Offer them Feb 18 or 19 as alternatives.

On Harbor Logistics — the TMS integration discussion is exactly the kind of expansion opportunity we want to surface in QBRs. Good catch. Make sure the solutions architect comes prepared with an integration architecture proposal. If the deal closes, it would push them over the $200K threshold into enterprise tier.

Everyone — please have all deck drafts in the shared folder by January 31. I'll be doing a review pass that weekend so we go into February QBRs with polished materials.

Thanks,
Amanda

Subject: RE: Enterprise QBR Schedule — Q1

Quick update from my end:

1. MegaPort Solutions: Confirmed for Jan 29 QBR. They're bringing their new CTO who started in December. I've put together a technical deep-dive section for him covering our API architecture, data pipeline, and security model. First impression with a new CTO matters a lot — this is essentially a re-sell conversation.

2. Continental Carriers: Renewal coming up in April. They've been a yellow account since November due to some support issues with data ingestion latency. I'm treating the QBR as a save conversation. Support tickets are down 40% since we implemented the dedicated support channel in December, so the trend is positive. Their account manager on their side has been responsive and I think we can get this back to green by March.

3. Pacific Route Inc: Everything is performing well. Usage metrics, NPS score, expansion pipeline — all in good shape. This will be a standard QBR. Their COO mentioned wanting to add the marine route optimization module in Q2.

Pipeline from my accounts:
- MegaPort expansion opportunity: $180K (new warehouse analytics module)
- Pacific Route upsell discussion: $95K (marine route optimization)
- Continental Carriers: holding at current ARR ($310K) — focus is retention, not expansion

For the QBR template, I noticed the ROI calculator section needs updating. The cost-savings formulas are using 2023 shipping and warehousing market rates. The 2024 rates are materially different due to the Red Sea disruptions. Should I update them?

Jamal,

Good call on the ROI calculator. Yes, please update the formulas with current market rates — use the FreightIndex Q4 2024 report as the baseline. Push the updated template to the shared folder and CC me when it's done so I can review before everyone starts using it.

On Continental Carriers — agreed that this is a save conversation. Let's do a pre-QBR strategy session for this one. Can you book 30 minutes with me on Jan 27? I want to walk through the support metrics and make sure our messaging is right. A $310K account is worth fighting for.

On MegaPort — the new CTO is a good opportunity but also a risk. New executives sometimes want to evaluate alternatives. Make sure the technical deep-dive covers our roadmap items that are relevant to their use case, and highlight the integration depth they'd lose by switching. Get specific numbers on their API call volume and data throughput.

Everyone — keep the updates coming. This is exactly the visibility I need heading into Q1. Let's make it a strong quarter.

Best,
Amanda
