NEXTERA SOLUTIONS — Q3 CLOSE-OUT FORECAST AND Q4 PLANNING
ENTERPRISE SALES REVIEW
Prepared by: Marcus DeWitt, Director Enterprise Sales
Date: September 23, 2025
Attendees: Marcus DeWitt, David Aldric (CEO), CFO Office, Tom Okafor (Head of Revenue Operations)
Document Classification: Internal — Executive Confidential

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report provides the executive leadership team with the Q3 2025 enterprise sales close-out forecast with eight days remaining in the quarter, a review of Q3 deal activity, and the Q4 2025 planning framework including pipeline analysis, target setting, and headcount recommendations. The enterprise sales organization enters the final week of Q3 in a strong position, with $8.7M in bookings closed against a $9.2M quarterly target (94.6% attainment). The forecast indicates that Q3 will close at $9.4M (102% of target) contingent on the execution of the BrightPath Health Systems contract, which is in final procurement review.

Q4 pipeline coverage stands at 3.2x ($47.1M unweighted pipeline against a $14.8M target), which is within the healthy range for enterprise sales cycles but will require disciplined execution to convert given the historically longer deal cycles in Q4 driven by customer budget approval timelines and holiday calendar compression.

2. REFERENCED ENTITIES

    Marcus DeWitt, Director Enterprise Sales — report author, responsible for the enterprise sales team (currently 8 account executives plus 2 sales engineers).

    David Aldric, CEO — attendee, provides strategic direction on deal prioritization and customer engagement. David participates directly in late-stage executive-level meetings for deals exceeding $500K ACV.

    Tom Okafor, Head of Revenue Operations — attendee, responsible for pipeline analytics, forecasting methodology, territory design, and sales process optimization. Tom's team maintains the Salesforce CRM instance and produces the pipeline and forecast reports referenced in this document.

    Nextera Solutions enterprise sales organization — the go-to-market team targeting companies with 500+ employees and deals with annual contract values exceeding $200K. The enterprise team is separate from the mid-market team (targeting companies with 100-500 employees) and the self-serve/SMB motion.

    BrightPath Health Systems — Stage 4 opportunity, $750K ACV. BrightPath is a regional healthcare system with 14 hospitals and 40+ outpatient facilities. They have been evaluating Nextera's supply chain analytics platform for medical supply chain optimization. The deal has been in procurement review since September 15.

    Lindenfeld Pharma — Stage 3 opportunity, $1.1M ACV. Lindenfeld is a mid-size pharmaceutical company with 6 manufacturing sites and complex API (active pharmaceutical ingredient) supply chains. Originally forecasted for Q3 close, the deal has been moved to Q4 due to Lindenfeld's internal budget cycle aligning approvals to their October fiscal period.

    Summit Electronics — closed-won, $470K ACV. Summit signed in early September for the core platform plus the anomaly detection module. Summit manufactures consumer electronics components and will use Nextera for component supplier risk monitoring.

3. Q3 2025 PERFORMANCE — DETAILED REVIEW

3.1 Bookings Summary

As of September 23, 2025, with 8 days remaining in the quarter:

    Q3 bookings target: $9.2M
    Q3 bookings closed to date: $8.7M (94.6% attainment)
    Q3 forecast (expected close by September 30): $9.4M (102% of target)

The forecast assumes that BrightPath Health Systems signs by September 29, adding $750K to the closed bookings. Excluding BrightPath, Q3 would close at $8.7M (94.6% attainment), which would represent the first below-target quarter in three quarters but would still be within the 90-105% acceptable performance band established by the board.

3.2 Deal Activity

Total deals closed in Q3 through September 23: 14 deals
    New logos: 7 (new customers signing their first Nextera contract)
    Expansions: 7 (existing customers adding modules, seats, or upgrading tiers)

Average deal size: $621K ACV across all 14 deals. This represents continued upward movement in deal size:
    Q1 2025 average deal size: $492K
    Q2 2025 average deal size: $548K
    Q3 2025 average deal size: $621K

The average selling price increase is driven by two factors: (a) the anomaly detection and supplier risk modules, launched in Q1 2025, are being attached to a higher percentage of deals (43% of Q3 deals included at least one new module versus 28% in Q1); and (b) the enterprise team has been more disciplined about qualifying opportunities at the right tier level during discovery, resulting in fewer deals that start at a lower tier and require post-sale expansion.

Notable Q3 closed deals:

    Summit Electronics: $470K ACV, new logo. Core platform + anomaly detection module. 3-year term. Sales cycle: 5 months. AE: Rina Vasquez.

    MedPharma Group: $890K ACV, expansion. Added supplier risk module and demand planning module to existing core platform deployment. The expansion was driven by MedPharma's CFO mandate to consolidate supply chain visibility tools after a Q2 supply disruption. AE: Jake Thornton.

    Velocity Automotive: $410K ACV, new logo. Core platform for automotive parts supply chain. 2-year term with year-2 expansion option for anomaly detection. AE: Aisha Obi.

3.3 Win Rate Analysis

    Enterprise win rate (Q3): 34%
    Mid-market win rate (Q3): 41%
    Blended win rate (Q3): 37%

The enterprise win rate of 34% is consistent with the trailing four-quarter average of 33%. The primary reasons for enterprise losses in Q3 were: (a) lost to incumbent vendor (3 deals — customers decided to expand existing SAP or Oracle supply chain solutions rather than adopt a new platform); (b) budget deferred to next fiscal year (2 deals); (c) lost to direct competitor (1 deal — lost to Kinaxis on a manufacturing-heavy opportunity where their MRP integration was more mature).

3.4 BrightPath Health Systems — Deal Update

BrightPath Health Systems represents the key outstanding Q3 deal. Status as of September 23:

    Stage: 4 (Procurement/Legal review)
    ACV: $750K
    Term: 36 months
    Modules: Core platform, anomaly detection, demand planning
    Champion: VP Supply Chain
    Economic buyer: CFO (approved budget in August 2025 board meeting)
    Current status: Procurement sent contract redline on September 22. The redline contains modifications to the limitation of liability clause and the data processing terms. Nextera Legal is reviewing the redline and expects to return a response by September 24.

Marcus DeWitt provided the following assessment: "We'll beat Q3 target if BrightPath closes on schedule. Their procurement team sent the redline yesterday — it's minor stuff."

The redline issues are standard for healthcare organizations and do not represent substantive commercial disagreements. BrightPath's VP Supply Chain has confirmed via email that the deal has internal approval and the redline is a procedural step. Expected signature date: September 29.

4. Q4 2025 PLANNING

4.1 Pipeline Overview

    Q4 bookings target: $14.8M
    Q4 pipeline (unweighted): $47.1M
    Q4 pipeline coverage: 3.2x ($47.1M / $14.8M)

Pipeline coverage of 3.2x is within the target range of 3.0-3.5x for enterprise sales. The pipeline includes 42 opportunities across all stages, with the following stage distribution:

    Stage 1 (Discovery): 12 opportunities, $14.2M unweighted
    Stage 2 (Technical Evaluation): 11 opportunities, $12.8M unweighted
    Stage 3 (Business Case/Budget): 10 opportunities, $11.6M unweighted
    Stage 4 (Procurement/Legal): 5 opportunities, $5.3M unweighted
    Stage 5 (Verbal Commit): 4 opportunities, $3.2M unweighted

Weighted pipeline (using stage-based probability weights): $16.2M, representing 109% coverage of the $14.8M target. The weighted pipeline provides a more realistic view of expected Q4 close and suggests that the $14.8M target is achievable with normal conversion rates.

David Aldric provided the following comment: "Pipeline coverage at 3.2x is healthy. But I want to see conversion rates hold. Last year we had 3.5x coverage and only hit 101% because deals slipped."

4.2 Key Q4 Opportunities

    Lindenfeld Pharma: $1.1M ACV, Stage 3. Moved from Q3 to Q4 commit following confirmation that Lindenfeld's internal budget approval aligns with their October fiscal cycle. Budget approval is now confirmed. Expected close: October 2025.

    Meridian Aerospace: $680K ACV, Stage 4. Aerospace parts supply chain. POC completed in September with strong results. Legal review underway. Expected close: November 2025.

    Pacific Rim Shipping: $540K ACV, Stage 2. Container logistics and port-to-warehouse visibility. Early stage but moving quickly due to an active RFP process. Decision expected by December 2025.

    TerraVerde Agriculture: $380K ACV, Stage 3. Agricultural commodity supply chain. Budget confirmed, evaluating Nextera against one competitor (E2open). Expected close: November 2025.

4.3 Headcount Recommendation

The enterprise sales team currently has 8 account executives (3 West, 3 Central, 2 East) plus 2 sales engineers. Based on the Q4 pipeline volume and the expanding deal count, Marcus DeWitt recommends adding 2 additional enterprise AEs in Q4 to handle the increased pipeline and ensure adequate coverage across territories.

Tom Okafor offered an alternative perspective: "The mid-market pipeline is actually stronger than enterprise right now. We should consider whether the two new AEs should be mid-market instead."

The mid-market pipeline stands at $28.4M unweighted against a $9.5M Q4 target (3.0x coverage), with a higher win rate (41% versus 34% enterprise) and shorter sales cycles (average 68 days versus 112 days for enterprise). The mid-market team currently has 5 AEs.

Recommendation: Hire 1 enterprise AE (East region, where coverage is thinnest) and 1 mid-market AE (general territory). Compensation budget for both roles: approximately $340K annual OTE ($170K each, split 50/50 base/variable). Recruiting timeline: begin search immediately, target start date late November to early December 2025 for both roles.

5. FORECAST METHODOLOGY NOTES

Forecasting uses a three-tier model maintained by Revenue Operations:

    Commit: Deals where the AE has high confidence in close within the quarter and the champion has verbally confirmed the timeline. Weighted at 90%.
    Best Case: Deals where the evaluation is positive and budget has been identified but timing or procurement process creates uncertainty. Weighted at 50%.
    Upside: Deals in early evaluation stages that could accelerate based on customer urgency. Weighted at 15%.

The Q3 close-out forecast of $9.4M consists of $8.7M closed + $750K in Commit (BrightPath at 90% probability). No Best Case or Upside deals are included in the Q3 forecast given the 8-day remaining window.

6. CONCLUSION

Q3 enterprise sales performance is strong, with the team on track to exceed target pending BrightPath execution. The Q4 pipeline is healthy at 3.2x coverage, and the Lindenfeld Pharma deal moving to Q4 with confirmed budget adds a strong anchor to the quarter. The headcount recommendation of 2 additional AEs (1 enterprise, 1 mid-market) is supported by pipeline volume and should be initiated immediately to have the new hires productive by Q1 2026.

3. SESSION 1: PRODUCT RELEASE REVIEW (10:00 AM - 11:15 AM)

The Head of Product presented a summary of product releases delivered since the Spring 2025 CAB session. Key releases included:

    Anomaly Detection Module v2.1 (July 2025): Added multi-variable anomaly detection using ensemble methods. Reduced false positive rate from 12% to 6.8% based on production data across all customers. Added configurable alert thresholds by category (supplier, logistics, demand) and severity level.

    Demand Planning Dashboard Refresh (August 2025): Redesigned the demand planning UI based on feedback from the Spring 2025 CAB session. New features include: drag-and-drop scenario comparison, historical accuracy tracking with confidence intervals, and exportable PDF reports for executive distribution.

    API v3.0 (September 2025): Launched REST API version 3.0 with GraphQL support, improved rate limiting (10,000 requests/hour per customer, up from 5,000), and webhook support for real-time event notifications. This release was specifically requested by NovaTech at the Spring session.

    Platform Performance Improvements: Average API response time reduced from 340ms to 210ms through database query optimization and caching layer improvements. Dashboard load times reduced by 35% through front-end bundle optimization and lazy loading.

CAB member feedback on releases was collected through a brief survey at the start of the session:
    Anomaly Detection v2.1: Average satisfaction 4.3/5 (up from 3.6 for v2.0)
    Demand Planning Dashboard: Average satisfaction 4.1/5 (new dashboard, no baseline)
    API v3.0: Average satisfaction 4.6/5 (highest-rated release)

4. SESSION 2: 2026 ROADMAP PREVIEW AND PRIORITY VOTE (11:30 AM - 1:00 PM)

The Head of Product presented three major roadmap themes planned for 2026. Each theme was presented with a 15-minute overview, followed by 10 minutes of Q&A and discussion.

4.1 Theme 1: AI-Driven Scenario Planning (Target: H1 2026)

Concept: Use machine learning models to generate "what-if" scenarios for supply chain disruptions. Given a hypothetical disruption (port closure, supplier bankruptcy, demand spike), the system would model cascading effects across the supply chain and recommend mitigation strategies. The models would be trained on each customer's historical data and supplemented with industry-wide disruption databases.

Customer Feedback: Strong enthusiasm from all CAB members. Crestline's VP Supply Chain noted that their team currently builds scenarios manually in spreadsheets, which takes 2-3 days per scenario. NovaTech's Head of Analytics asked about model transparency and the ability to inspect feature importance in the scenario outputs. The Chief Architect confirmed that the planned architecture includes an explainability layer showing which input variables drive each scenario outcome.

4.2 Theme 2: Multi-Tier Supplier Visibility (Target: Q2 2026)

Concept: Extend supply chain visibility beyond direct (Tier 1) suppliers to include sub-suppliers (Tier 2 and Tier 3). The feature would use a combination of customer-provided supplier data, public corporate registries, and a proprietary data network to map multi-tier supplier relationships and identify concentration risks.

Customer Feedback: Crestline identified this as their top priority. The Crestline VP Supply Chain stated: "We've reduced stockouts 22% but we still can't see past our Tier 1 suppliers. Multi-tier visibility would be a game-changer."

The discussion revealed that multi-tier visibility is a shared pain point across industries. NovaTech described a situation where a Tier 3 component supplier in Southeast Asia experienced a factory fire, and NovaTech did not learn about the impact on their supply chain until 6 weeks later when their Tier 1 supplier reported delivery delays.

4.3 Theme 3: Sustainability Metrics Dashboard (Target: H2 2026)

Concept: Add ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) tracking capabilities to the platform, including carbon footprint estimation for supply chain activities, supplier diversity scoring, and regulatory compliance tracking for EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) requirements.

Customer Feedback: Mixed enthusiasm. Three CAB members rated this as important for regulatory compliance but not a competitive differentiator. Two members said their sustainability teams are separate from supply chain operations and would need to be involved in the evaluation. NovaTech expressed the strongest interest, noting that their board has established a 2027 deadline for comprehensive supply chain carbon reporting.

4.4 Priority Vote Results

Each CAB member voted on their top two priorities from the three themes:

    AI-Driven Scenario Planning: 6 of 7 votes (top priority)
    Mobile-First Dashboards: 5 of 7 votes (second priority)
    API Marketplace: 4 of 7 votes (third priority)

Note: "Mobile-First Dashboards" and "API Marketplace" were added as voting options based on CAB member requests during the open discussion, replacing the Sustainability Metrics theme in the vote. The Sustainability Metrics theme remains on the roadmap but was not included in the final priority vote after CAB members indicated that the two additional options better reflected their operational needs.

5. SESSION 3: OPEN DISCUSSION AND CUSTOMER FEEDBACK (2:00 PM - 3:15 PM)

5.1 Compliance and Security

Redwood Financial's CTO raised the topic of SOC 2 Type II certification: "SOC 2 Type II is a hard requirement for our compliance team. We need that cert by Q1 or we'll have to evaluate alternatives."

Lena Cho confirmed that the SOC 2 Type II audit fieldwork begins in November 2025, with the completed report expected in Q1 2026. The target is to have the Type II report available for customer distribution by March 2026. Redwood's CTO acknowledged this timeline as acceptable, contingent on Nextera meeting the Q1 2026 target.

5.2 Mobile-First Dashboards

Vantage Retail Group's COO made a case for mobile-first dashboards: "Our store managers don't sit at desks. If the analytics aren't on their phone, they don't exist."

Vantage described their use case: 340 store managers who need daily access to inventory replenishment dashboards, stockout alerts, and supplier delivery ETAs. Currently, store managers must log into the Nextera web application on a laptop or desktop, which is impractical during store hours. A mobile-optimized dashboard with push notifications would enable real-time supply chain visibility at the store level.

The Head of Product indicated that mobile-first dashboards could be incorporated into the H1 2026 roadmap alongside the AI scenario planning theme, as the mobile work is primarily front-end development and could run in parallel with the backend AI/ML development.

5.3 API Marketplace

NovaTech Industries' Head of Analytics proposed an API marketplace concept: "We've built 14 custom connectors on top of your API. Other customers are probably building the same things. An open marketplace would let us share and monetize these connectors."

The concept envisions a marketplace where customers and third-party developers can publish, discover, and install pre-built data connectors, workflow automations, and analytics templates. NovaTech offered to contribute their existing connectors as seed content for the marketplace if Nextera provides the platform infrastructure.

The Chief Architect noted that API v3.0 was designed with extensibility in mind and that the marketplace concept is technically feasible. The Head of Product committed to exploring the marketplace as a Q3/Q4 2026 initiative.

5.4 CEO Closing Remarks

David Aldric addressed the CAB at the close of the session: "This is exactly the kind of feedback that shapes our roadmap. We're building Nextera for the long haul and your input is how we get there."

David thanked the CAB members for their time and confirmed that Nextera would publish a formal response to all CAB recommendations within 6 weeks, including updated roadmap timelines for each priority item.

6. ACTION ITEMS

12 action items were assigned during the session, with owners and target dates:

    1. Product: Publish formal response to CAB priority vote — target: November 3, 2025

NEXTERA SOLUTIONS — IMPLEMENTATION STATUS REPORT
CUSTOMER: Cascade Beverage Co.
REPORT DATE: September 23, 2025
CONTRACT ACV: $290,000
IMPLEMENTATION PHASE: Integration & Data Migration (Phase 2 of 4)

Prepared by: Derek Huang, Implementation Lead
Distribution: Priya Nair (Sr. Customer Success Manager), Lena Cho (VP Customer Success), Cascade Beverage Project Team
Document Classification: Internal

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This status report covers the implementation progress for Cascade Beverage Co. as of September 23, 2025. Cascade is a national beverage distributor with 6 warehouse locations and approximately $800M in annual revenue. The implementation is in Phase 2 (Integration and Data Migration) of Nextera's standard 4-phase, 60-day implementation playbook. Despite a 3-day delay caused by a schema mismatch in Cascade's warehouse management system, the implementation remains on track for the original go-live target of October 20, 2025 (Day 56 of the 60-day playbook).

Key milestones achieved this period: completed data mapping for 8 of 14 ERP integrations, ingested 18 months of historical purchase order data (1.2 million transactions), and deployed a custom translation layer to resolve the warehouse management system schema mismatch. User acceptance testing (UAT) has been scheduled for October 6 at Cascade's Denver headquarters.

2. REFERENCED ENTITIES

    Derek Huang, Implementation Lead — Nextera's primary technical owner for the Cascade implementation. Derek has completed 11 enterprise implementations at Nextera and specializes in complex multi-system integration scenarios.

    Priya Nair, Sr. Customer Success Manager — Nextera's commercial relationship owner for Cascade. Priya manages the overall account relationship, coordinates executive communication, and monitors implementation progress against the 60-day SLA.

    Cascade Beverage Co. — new Nextera customer. Contract signed August 22, 2025. ACV: $290K. Cascade is a national beverage distribution company serving 14,000 retail outlets across 22 states. They operate 6 warehouse/distribution facilities.

    Cascade IT Team — 4 engineers assigned to the Nextera integration project from Cascade's internal IT organization. The team includes 2 ERP specialists (SAP), 1 warehouse management system administrator, and 1 data engineer.

    Maya Torres, Cascade Project Sponsor (VP Operations) — the executive sponsor on the Cascade side. Maya approved the Nextera purchase and is responsible for ensuring organizational adoption and business value realization.

    Lisa Park, Integration Engineer — second Nextera integration engineer added to the project on September 18 to accelerate custom middleware development for the remaining 6 ERP integrations.

3. IMPLEMENTATION PLAYBOOK STATUS

Nextera's standard enterprise implementation follows a 4-phase, 60-day playbook:

    Phase 1: Discovery and Planning (Days 1-10) — COMPLETE
    Phase 2: Integration and Data Migration (Days 11-35) — IN PROGRESS (Day 32 of 35)
    Phase 3: User Acceptance Testing (Days 36-50) — SCHEDULED (begins October 6)
    Phase 4: Go-Live and Hypercare (Days 51-60) — PLANNED (target October 20)

Current project day: Day 32 (September 23, 2025).
Go-live target: October 20, 2025 (Day 56).

The 3-day delay incurred during Phase 2 due to the warehouse management system schema mismatch has been absorbed within the Phase 2 buffer period. No impact to the Phase 3 or Phase 4 schedule.

4. INTEGRATION PROGRESS

4.1 ERP Integration Status

Cascade's technology landscape includes 14 ERP system integrations required for full deployment:

    Completed (8 integrations):
    — SAP S/4HANA: Purchase order management (inbound/outbound data flows)
    — SAP S/4HANA: Vendor master data synchronization
    — SAP S/4HANA: Material master data synchronization
    — SAP S/4HANA: Inventory positions and stock levels
    — SAP S/4HANA: Accounts payable and payment terms
    — Cascade CRM (Salesforce): Customer and retail outlet master data
    — Cascade BI (Tableau): Reporting data exports (one-way, from Nextera)
    — Cascade Email System (Microsoft 365): Alert and notification delivery

    These 8 integrations use Nextera's standard SAP, Salesforce, Tableau, and Microsoft connectors. Derek Huang noted: "The SAP integrations are clean but their warehouse management system uses a legacy schema that doesn't map to our standard connectors. We've built a translation layer that handles it."

    Pending (6 integrations requiring custom middleware):
    — Warehouse Management System (WMS): Legacy system with non-standard product codes and custom data structures (see Section 5 below)
    — Transportation Management System (TMS): Carrier rate tables and shipment tracking
    — Demand Forecasting Tool: Proprietary internal tool built on Python/pandas
    — Quality Management System (QMS): Product recall and quality hold data
    — EDI Gateway: Electronic data interchange with retail customer POS systems
    — IoT Sensor Platform: Warehouse temperature and humidity monitoring data

    The 6 remaining integrations require custom middleware because Cascade uses either legacy systems with non-standard schemas, proprietary internal tools, or IoT platforms that do not have pre-built Nextera connectors. Lisa Park was added to the team on September 18 to handle middleware development for these integrations.

4.2 Historical Data Migration

Ingested data:
    — 18 months of historical purchase order data: 1,200,000 transactions covering the period March 2024 through August 2025
    — 23,000 SKUs mapped from Cascade's product catalog to Nextera's taxonomy
    — 8,400 vendor records synchronized from SAP vendor master
    — 14,000 retail outlet records synchronized from Salesforce CRM

Data validation: Initial data quality checks identified 342 duplicate vendor records (4.1% of total) and 187 SKU mapping conflicts where Cascade's product codes mapped to multiple Nextera taxonomy entries. Derek's team resolved the vendor duplicates through a deduplication script validated by Cascade's data engineer. The SKU mapping conflicts were resolved through a mapping review session with Cascade's category management team on September 19, where each conflict was manually resolved and the mapping table was updated.

5. WAREHOUSE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM SCHEMA ISSUE

5.1 Problem Description

Cascade's warehouse management system (WMS) is a 12-year-old on-premise application originally built by a software vendor that was acquired and discontinued in 2019. Cascade's IT team has maintained and extended the system internally since then. The WMS uses a non-standard product identification schema that differs from both Cascade's SAP system and industry-standard product codes (UPC/EAN).

Specifically, the WMS uses a proprietary 8-character alphanumeric product code format (e.g., "BV-A2-004") that encodes the beverage category (BV=beverage, SP=spirits, DA=dairy), warehouse zone (A1-F6), and sequential item number. These codes do not map directly to Nextera's product taxonomy or to the UPC codes used in Cascade's SAP system.

5.2 Resolution

Derek's team built a translation layer that maps between the three code systems: WMS proprietary codes, SAP material numbers, and Nextera taxonomy identifiers. The translation layer operates as a middleware service that intercepts data flowing from the WMS to Nextera and performs real-time code translation using a lookup table maintained jointly by Cascade's WMS administrator and Nextera's integration team.

The translation layer was deployed on September 20 and has been processing WMS data for 3 days without errors. The lookup table currently covers 23,000 SKUs (the complete active product catalog). New SKUs added to the WMS will require a corresponding entry in the translation table, which Cascade's WMS administrator will manage through a simple web interface provided as part of the middleware.

The schema mismatch was identified on September 12 and the translation layer was fully deployed on September 20, representing a 3-business-day delay against the original integration schedule. This delay was absorbed within the Phase 2 buffer period (5 days of buffer were allocated in the original project plan).

Priya Nair provided the following assessment: "Cascade is complex but on track. The schema issue cost us 3 days but we've absorbed it within the original 60-day window."

6. WAREHOUSE LOCATIONS

Cascade Beverage operates 6 warehouse/distribution facilities, each of which will be connected to the Nextera platform:

    Denver, CO (HQ and primary distribution): 450,000 sq ft, handles 35% of total volume
    Phoenix, AZ: 280,000 sq ft, handles 18% of volume
    Atlanta, GA: 320,000 sq ft, handles 20% of volume
    Chicago, IL: 260,000 sq ft, handles 12% of volume
    Dallas, TX: 240,000 sq ft, handles 10% of volume
    Portland, OR: 180,000 sq ft, handles 5% of volume

All 6 facilities use the same WMS instance (centrally hosted at Denver) and the same SAP S/4HANA deployment. Integration is centralized, so the technical work applies to all facilities simultaneously. However, UAT will be conducted at Denver first, with remote validation sessions for the other 5 facilities during the following week.

7. USER ACCEPTANCE TESTING PLAN

UAT is scheduled for October 6, 2025, at Cascade's Denver headquarters.

Participants:
    Cascade: 12 participants including Maya Torres (VP Operations, project sponsor), 4 warehouse operations managers, 3 procurement analysts, 2 demand planners, and 2 IT team members.
    Nextera: 3 engineers on-site (Derek Huang, Lisa Park, and one additional integration engineer from the Denver-based team).

UAT Scope:
    Day 1 (October 6): Core platform walkthrough, dashboard configuration, data accuracy validation against SAP source records, and historical data spot-checks.
    Day 2 (October 7): Integration testing — live data flow verification from SAP, WMS (via translation layer), and CRM into Nextera. Alert configuration and notification testing.
    Day 3 (October 8): Anomaly detection module testing with simulated disruption scenarios. Demand planning module walkthrough with Cascade's demand planning team.

Success Criteria:
    — 100% of historical data accessible and matching SAP source records (tolerance: <0.1% discrepancy)
    — Real-time data flow latency under 60 seconds from source system change to Nextera dashboard update
    — All 6 warehouse locations visible and reporting correctly
    — Zero critical defects; minor defects documented and scheduled for resolution before go-live

Maya Torres expressed enthusiasm for the UAT milestone: "We're excited about the UAT milestone. Our Denver team has been asking when they'll get hands on the dashboards."

8. RISK REGISTER

    Risk 1: Custom middleware for 6 remaining integrations may reveal additional schema incompatibilities.
    Mitigation: Lisa Park is conducting schema analysis for all 6 systems before beginning middleware development. Any issues will be identified before code is written.
    Likelihood: Medium. Impact: Low (buffer time available).

    Risk 2: UAT may uncover data accuracy issues in the translation layer for edge-case SKUs.
    Mitigation: The translation layer includes comprehensive logging. Any mapping failures are logged with full context and queued for manual resolution.
    Likelihood: Low. Impact: Low (individual SKU fixes, not systemic).

    Risk 3: Go-live may be delayed if Cascade's demand planning team requires additional training.
    Mitigation: Pre-UAT training materials have been shared with Cascade's demand planners. A dedicated training session is scheduled for October 9, the day after UAT.
    Likelihood: Low. Impact: Medium (could shift go-live by 3-5 days).

9. NEXT MILESTONES
