AGENDA ITEM 1 — PROJECT LIGHTHOUSE: MERIDIAN CORP UPDATE

Mr. Aldric reported that Meridian Corp's board meeting is confirmed for March 14 and that CEO Gerald Fisk has indicated intent to present a formal offer.

Mr. Aldric provided the following update:

1. Mr. Fisk's most recent communication (March 2, 2025, via secure channel) confirmed that the Meridian Corp board of directors will convene on March 14, 2025, with Project Lighthouse as the primary agenda item. Mr. Fisk stated that he intends to recommend to his board that they authorize a formal offer for Nextera Solutions.

2. The expected offer structure is an all-cash stock purchase. Mr. Fisk has not committed to a specific price in writing but has verbally indicated a range consistent with prior discussions ($850M-$950M).

3. Mr. Fisk has requested that Nextera's data room be available for Meridian's due diligence team within 5 business days of LOI execution. This aligns with the current data room preparation timeline.

4. Mr. Aldric confirmed that no other potential acquirers have approached Nextera. The board's strategy remains exclusive negotiation with Meridian.

5. Integration planning continues at a high level. Meridian has shared a preliminary integration framework document (non-binding) that confirms retention of Nextera's engineering team and San Francisco office. The document references a 12-month integration timeline with a dedicated Meridian integration PMO.

Discussion: Mr. Whitfield asked about break-up fee provisions in the anticipated LOI. Mr. Stern from Wachtell advised that standard practice for transactions in this range is a mutual break-up fee of 2-3% of transaction value ($18M-$27M at $900M). He recommended that Nextera negotiate for a reverse break-up fee (payable by Meridian if they fail to close) at 3% and accept a company break-up fee (payable by Nextera if they pursue a competing offer) at 2%. The board agreed to this negotiating position.

Ms. Patel asked about exclusivity provisions. Mr. Stern advised that the LOI will likely contain a 60-90 day exclusivity period during which Nextera cannot solicit or engage with competing bidders. He recommended accepting a 60-day exclusivity window with a 30-day extension option at Meridian's request, subject to board approval of the extension. The board agreed.

Mr. Kessler asked about the timeline from LOI to definitive agreement. Mr. Stern outlined the typical timeline: LOI execution (late March), due diligence period (60-90 days, April-June), definitive agreement negotiation (30-45 days, overlapping with due diligence), board approval and signing (target: June-July 2025), HSR filing and regulatory review (30-45 days), and closing (target: August-September 2025). Total estimated timeline from LOI to closing: 5-6 months.

AGENDA ITEM 2 — GOLDMAN SACHS UPDATED VALUATION

Ms. Vasquez presented Goldman Sachs' updated valuation analysis reflecting Q1 outperformance.

Ms. Vasquez presented Goldman Sachs' updated valuation analysis: fair value range $880M to $1.02B, reflecting Q1 outperformance.

Changes from the February 26 preliminary analysis ($820M-$1.05B):

A. Updated Financial Inputs
- Q1 revenue now projected at $31.8M (7% above $29.7M plan), up from $30.5M assumption in prior analysis
- ARR updated to $126.4M (up from $122.4M in prior analysis)
- Net revenue retention updated to 121% (up from 118% assumption)
- Gross margin updated to 79.1% (up from 78.4% assumption)

B. Comparable Company Analysis (updated)
- EV/ARR multiples: range narrowed to 6.8x to 9.0x (from 6.2x to 9.8x) based on Q4 2024 earnings reports from comparable companies
- Applied to updated ARR of $126.4M
- Comparable company implied range: $860M to $1.14B
- Selected range: $880M to $1.02B

C. Discounted Cash Flow Analysis (updated)
- Revenue CAGR assumption revised upward to 23% (from 22%) based on Q1 trajectory
- WACC unchanged at 12.5%
- DCF implied range: $910M to $1.08B

D. Precedent Transaction Analysis (updated)
- No new comparable transactions since February analysis
- Range unchanged: $850M to $1.05B

E. Synthesis
- Updated fair value range: $880M to $1.02B
- This represents 7.0x to 8.1x Nextera's updated ARR of $126.4M
- The narrowing of the range reflects increased confidence in the financial trajectory
- Midpoint: $950M

Mr. Caldwell: "The Q1 outperformance supports a meaningful upward revision in our fair value floor. We've raised the low end from $820M to $880M and tightened the high end from $1.05B to $1.02B. The midpoint of our range is now $950M, which is $50M above Meridian's indicated offer of $900M."

Ms. Liu added: "If we adjust for Q1 outperformance using a straight ARR multiple, Meridian's $900M offer represents 7.1x ARR on the updated $126.4M figure. This is at the lower end of our range. We believe there is room to negotiate upward, and our recommendation is that the board target a minimum of $920M-$940M."

Discussion: Mr. Kessler asked whether Goldman Sachs believes Meridian would walk away if Nextera counters at $950M. Mr. Caldwell stated that based on his team's analysis of Meridian's strategic rationale and financial capacity, he believes Meridian has flexibility to go above $900M. However, he cautioned that pushing for a price significantly above the midpoint could extend the negotiation timeline and introduce risk. His recommendation: counter at $950M with a willingness to settle in the $920M-$940M range.

Ms. Patel asked about the impact of the Axion integration on valuation. Mr. Caldwell stated that the Axion partnership adds strategic value but is difficult to quantify at this stage since it is pre-revenue. Goldman Sachs has not included Axion-related revenue in their base case projections but noted it as upside potential that could be used as a qualitative argument for higher valuation.

AGENDA ITEM 3 — TRANSITION COST REVIEW

Ms. Vasquez presented the transition cost models prepared by her team, as requested at the February 26 board session.

Board reviews transition cost models: total estimated costs $33.1M at restructured rates.

Summary of transition costs (base estimate):

| Cost Category               | Amount    | Notes                                      |
|-----------------------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------|
| Executive severance         | $12.4M    | 14 executives, single/double-trigger mix    |
| Non-exec severance (1x)    | $9.0M     | Restructured rate, effective March 1        |
| Retention bonuses           | $8.2M     | Maximum, assuming 100% enrollment           |
| Vendor breakage             | $2.1M     | Conservative estimate                       |
| Lease costs                 | $1.4M     | Consent fees + early termination            |
| **Total seller costs**      | **$33.1M**| **Deducted from stockholder proceeds**      |

Additional costs (buyer-borne, not deducted from price):
- D&O tail insurance: $1.0M (6-year tail)
- Integration costs: $5.0M (estimated, Meridian's expense)
- Equity acceleration: $30.0M (most likely case, mix of single and double-trigger)

Ms. Vasquez noted that the severance restructuring from 2x to 1x for non-executive employees, which became effective March 1, reduced the non-executive severance exposure from $18M to $9M — a savings of $9M. This restructuring was completed in time for the data room package.

Mr. Whitfield asked about the net proceeds to stockholders. Ms. Vasquez presented the following waterfall:

At $900M transaction value (stock sale):
- Gross proceeds: $900.0M
- Less: seller transition costs: ($33.1M)
- Less: Goldman Sachs success fee: ($4.5M)
- Less: Wachtell fees (estimated total): ($0.5M)
- Less: other transaction costs (escrow, filing fees): ($1.5M)
- Net pre-tax proceeds: $860.4M
- Estimated tax (approximately 37% blended rate): ($318.3M)
- Net after-tax proceeds: $542.1M

At $950M transaction value (Goldman Sachs recommendation):
- Gross proceeds: $950.0M
- Less: seller transition costs: ($33.1M)
- Less: Goldman Sachs success fee (0.5%): ($4.75M)
- Less: Wachtell fees: ($0.5M)
- Less: other transaction costs: ($1.5M)
- Net pre-tax proceeds: $910.15M
- Estimated tax: ($336.8M)
- Net after-tax proceeds: $573.4M

The $50M difference in offer price results in approximately $31.3M additional after-tax proceeds for stockholders.

Discussion: The board discussed the transition cost summary at length. Mr. Kessler noted that the $33.1M in seller transition costs represents 3.7% of the $900M transaction value, which he described as reasonable for a transaction of this size and complexity. Ms. Patel asked whether Meridian would seek to negotiate any of these costs as conditions of the offer. Mr. Stern advised that retention bonuses and executive severance are standard and typically accepted by acquirers, but that the vendor breakage and lease costs could be a point of negotiation.

AGENDA ITEM 4 — DATA ROOM STATUS

Ms. Dominguez reported on the current status of data room preparation.

Ms. Dominguez reported data room preparation is 90% complete. 2,160 of approximately 2,400 documents loaded. Financial, legal, and IP categories are complete. HR and technology categories on track for March 14.

| Technology           | 135             | 220            | 61%        |
| Regulatory           | 50              | 90             | 56%        |
| **Total**            | **2,160**       | **2,400**      | **90%**    |

Wachtell Lipton has completed review of the financial and legal sections. Mr. Stern confirmed that no privileged or inadvertently included documents were identified. The IP section review is in progress and expected to be complete by March 7.

Ms. Dominguez confirmed that the remaining categories (HR, Technology, Data Privacy, Regulatory) are on track for completion by March 14, aligned with Meridian's board meeting date. The data room will be fully ready for opening upon LOI execution.

Staffing update: Nathan Foley continues as project lead. The two assigned paralegals (Jennifer Okafor and Raj Sundaram) are working full-time on document formatting and upload. Department heads (Vanessa Kline for HR, Marcus Webb for Technology, Frank Huang for Data Privacy) are providing documents on schedule.

AGENDA ITEM 5 — BOARD RESOLUTIONS

RESOLVED: The Board authorizes the CEO to negotiate letter of intent terms with Meridian Corp within the fair value range of $880M to $1.02B. Vote: 4-0.

Discussion preceding the vote: Mr. Kessler summarized the board's collective view that the company is well-positioned to negotiate from a position of strength. Q1 performance is ahead of plan, the product is executing well, and the data room is nearly complete. He recommended that the CEO target a price at or above the Goldman Sachs midpoint of $950M and accept no less than $920M without returning to the board for further discussion.

Mr. Aldric confirmed his understanding of the board's guidance and committed to providing daily updates to the Board Chair once formal negotiations commence.

RESOLVED: The Board authorizes opening of the Project Lighthouse data room upon execution of a mutually acceptable letter of intent. Vote: 4-0.

Discussion: Ms. Dominguez confirmed that "mutually acceptable" means the LOI must be reviewed and approved by both Wachtell Lipton and the General Counsel before the data room is opened to Meridian.

EXECUTIVE SESSION

The Board entered executive session at 11:15 AM. Management and external advisors were excused. The executive session lasted 30 minutes.

Upon return from executive session, Mr. Kessler reported that the board discussed CEO compensation arrangements in connection with a potential change of control. No resolutions were adopted. The board directed Ms. Dominguez to prepare a summary of Mr. Aldric's current compensation and severance terms for the next session.

ADJOURNMENT

There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 11:45 AM. Total meeting duration: 3 hours 15 minutes.

The next regular board meeting is scheduled for March 18, 2025. A special session will be convened upon receipt of a formal offer from Meridian Corp.

:tada: Axion integration demo was a hit! All 18 endpoints live in staging, data quality at 99.8%, latency under 200ms. We're ready for customer beta.

Full demo recap from last Friday (February 28):

Demo attendees: 42 people (engineering, product, sales, CS, executive team)
Demo duration: 75 minutes (45 minute presentation + 30 minute live Q&A)

What we showed:
1. Real-time lane pricing from Axion — live data flowing through our pipeline and rendering in the recommendation engine
2. Route optimization using Axion's container tracking data — demonstrated 3 optimization scenarios with anonymized customer data
3. Port congestion index — real-time visualization of global port congestion using Axion's maritime data feed
4. Demand forecasting with historical Axion data — 12-month backtest showing 18% improvement in forecast accuracy vs. our existing model
5. Full API documentation and developer portal walkthrough

Technical metrics from the demo:
- All 18 API endpoints integrated and functioning in staging environment
- Data quality: 99.8% schema compliance across all event types
- End-to-end latency: 143ms average (under our 200ms target)
- Processing throughput: 3.2M events/day (up from 2.8M two weeks ago)
- Uptime during demo: 100% (zero errors, zero timeouts)
- Data freshness: real-time events arriving within 2.3 seconds of source generation

The demo ran without a single technical issue. Ben Arujo and the integration team delivered this 1 week ahead of schedule. The engineering execution on this project has been flawless.

[9:20 AM] ben.arujo
Thank you @hannah.choi. The team is proud of this one. A few more technical details:

Integration architecture:
- Kafka-based event pipeline (Confluent Cloud) processing Axion events
- Schema Registry enforcing strict type contracts on all 47 event types
- Redis caching layer for frequently accessed lane pricing (cache hit rate: 92%)
- PostgreSQL materialized views for historical analysis (refreshed every 15 minutes)
- Custom data quality monitoring dashboard (Grafana)

The three endpoints that were in progress two weeks ago (batch historical data retrieval x2 and webhook management) are now fully complete and tested:
- Batch historical — shipment: supports queries up to 90 days back, returns in <3 seconds for typical queries
- Batch historical — lane: supports queries up to 180 days back, returns in <5 seconds
- Webhook management: full CRUD operations for event subscriptions, supports filtering by event type, geography, and carrier

[9:25 AM] diana.marsh
Customer beta waitlist: 45 accounts already signed up. That's 21% of our customer base wanting early access.

Waitlist breakdown:
- Enterprise: 22 accounts (26% of enterprise base)
- Mid-Market: 18 accounts (19% of mid-market base)
- Emerging: 5 accounts (12% of emerging base)

Top enterprise accounts on the waitlist: Maersk, DB Schenker, LogiFlow, Kuehne+Nagel, GlobalShip, Nippon Express, Freight Corp, TransPacific Logistics. These 8 accounts alone represent $4.65M in ACV.

I've already included the Axion integration preview in 6 active enterprise proposals. Prospects are very excited about the real-time logistics data capabilities. This is going to be a meaningful differentiator in competitive situations.

[9:30 AM] kai.brennan
Congratulations to the Nextera team. This is exactly the kind of technical collaboration that makes great products. Excited for our customers to see this.

From Axion's side, we're equally impressed with the integration quality. Your data quality standards (99.8% schema compliance) are the highest of any integration partner in our ecosystem. We're featuring Nextera as a showcase integration in our next partner newsletter.

Looking forward to the beta launch in June and GA in September. Business as usual — just better data.

[9:33 AM] hannah.choi
Thank you @kai.brennan! The partnership has been fantastic from day one.

We're on track: beta June, GA September. This partnership is going to be a game-changer for our platform. Business as usual — just better data.

Updated timeline:
- March 3-7: Internal demo follow-up, gather feedback from 42 attendees
- March 10-21: Address feedback items, performance optimization
- April 1-30: Internal testing with synthetic data at production scale
- May 1-31: Closed beta with 5 design partner customers (selection by March 15)
- June 1: Open beta launch (45+ customers on waitlist)
- June-August: Beta feedback collection, iteration, scale testing
- September 1: General availability launch

Design partner selection criteria:
1. Enterprise segment (>$100K ACV)
2. Active Axion data consumer (must use at least 3 of the 18 endpoints)
3. Willing to commit 1 engineering resource for integration testing (2 hours/week)
4. Diverse industry representation (ocean freight, road freight, warehousing, intermodal)
5. Willing to provide written feedback and participate in case study

[9:38 AM] marcus.webb
Incredible work team. The v3 + Axion combination is going to be a very powerful product offering. Our technology platform has never been stronger.

One thing I want to highlight: the integration was delivered with zero impact to our existing production systems. The team built the entire Axion pipeline in isolation, tested it thoroughly, and it will slot into production when we're ready. No shortcuts, no technical debt. That's the engineering culture I'm proud of.

[9:42 AM] carlos.rivera
From the hackathon team — ChainWhisperer passed its product review last Friday. We're now in formal evaluation for Q3 roadmap inclusion. If approved, it will be our first AI-native feature that combines Axion data with natural language processing. Exciting times ahead.

[9:45 AM] tomas.lindgren
From CS: customer reactions to the demo have been overwhelmingly positive. I shared a sanitized demo recording with 12 key accounts and 10 of them asked about early access. The demand signal is very strong.

Customer feedback quotes from the demo recording distribution:
- Maersk VP Digital Innovation: "The port congestion index alone would save us $4M/year in demurrage costs."
- DB Schenker Head of Analytics: "The historical demand forecasting accuracy improvement from 12% to 30% would transform our European capacity planning."
- LogiFlow COO: "When can we get this? We want to be first in line for beta."

[9:48 AM] raj.patel
Platform performance update: staging environment running the full Axion integration has been stable for 14 consecutive days. Zero incidents, zero data loss, zero schema violations. CPU utilization on the Axion pipeline pods averages 34% at peak throughput (3.2M events/day), giving us significant headroom for production scale.

Memory consumption: 2.8GB per pod (allocated 4GB), garbage collection pauses under 15ms. The Kafka consumer group is maintaining zero lag at current throughput levels.

Subject: Data Room Status and Pre-LOI Readiness

David,

Data room status: 2,160 of approximately 2,400 documents loaded. Wachtell has signed off on the financial and legal sections.

Remaining items: HR benefits documentation (Vanessa's team uploading this week), technology architecture diagrams (Marcus's team, due March 7), and data privacy impact assessments (Frank's team, due March 10).

We are on track to have the data room fully ready by March 14, aligned with Meridian's board meeting date.

Detailed status by workstream:

A. Document Upload Status
- Seven categories are 100% complete (Financial, Legal, IP, Corporate Governance, Insurance, Tax, Environmental)
- Four categories are 86-94% complete (Customer, Real Estate, IP Licenses, Data Privacy) — remaining documents are in final formatting
- Three categories are 56-76% complete (HR, Technology, Regulatory) — these are the categories requiring active effort this week

B. Wachtell Review Status
- Financial section: APPROVED (reviewed February 28)
- Legal section: APPROVED (reviewed March 1)
- IP section: IN REVIEW (expected approval March 7)
- Corporate Governance section: APPROVED (reviewed March 2)
- Remaining sections: scheduled for review March 10-14

C. Outstanding Items Requiring Your Attention
1. Marcus Webb needs to provide technology architecture diagrams by March 7. I've sent him the request using the cover story (annual governance review). He asked no questions but his team is occupied with v3 post-launch support and the Axion integration. I may need you to reprioritize if we see delays.

2. Vanessa Kline's team is uploading HR benefits documents this week. The complexity is that we have 14 distinct benefit plans across 5 carriers, and each requires the plan document, summary plan description, and amendment history. Vanessa estimates 80 documents total for this subcategory.

3. Frank Huang's data privacy impact assessments are due March 10. We have 8 DPIAs covering our major data processing activities. All are current except for the rec engine v3 DPIA, which is being updated to reflect the new recommendation algorithm. Frank expects completion by March 8.

D. Counterparty Consent Readiness
Counterparty consent templates are drafted and approved by Wachtell. We can deploy these within 48 hours of LOI execution.

Nathan Foley completed the counterparty consent analysis (see NXS-LEGAL-2025-018) identifying 21 agreements requiring consent. Template letters are ready for deployment. I recommend we have the consent letters pre-addressed and staged so we can send them within 48 hours of LOI signing.

Consent letter deployment plan:
- Day 0 (LOI execution): final review and customization of 21 consent letters
- Day 1-2: mail/email consent requests to all 21 counterparties
- Day 3-7: follow-up calls from CSM team (for customer consents) and legal team (for lease consents)
- Day 14-21: escalation for non-responsive counterparties
- Day 30: target for 90%+ consent completion

E. Wachtell Billings Update
Total Wachtell billings to date: $340K
Projected total through data room completion: $420K
Projected total through LOI execution: $500K
Projected total through definitive agreement: $1.2M-$1.5M

Breakdown of billings to date:
- David Stern (Partner): 62 hours at $2,100/hr = $130,200
- Sarah Kim (Associate): 88 hours at $1,250/hr = $110,000
- Research and filing fees: $22,000
- Paralegal support: 156 hours at $500/hr = $78,000

- Cash usage driven by: operating expenses ($2.0M net outflow after collections), capital expenditures ($180K), and timing of payroll and vendor payments

II. YEAR-OVER-YEAR COMPARISON

| Metric                  | Q1 2024    | Q1 2025    | YoY Growth |
|-------------------------|------------|------------|------------|
| Revenue                 | $25.2M     | $31.8M     | +26.2%     |
| ARR (end of quarter)    | $102.1M    | $126.4M    | +23.8%     |
| Gross margin            | 76.8%      | 79.1%      | +230 bps   |
| Headcount               | 368        | 418        | +13.6%     |
| Customer count           | 198        | 221        | +11.6%     |
| NPS                     | 52         | 64         | +12 pts    |

Revenue growth (26.2%) is outpacing headcount growth (13.6%), demonstrating improving unit economics and operational leverage.

Revenue per employee: $76.1K (Q1 2025 annualized) vs. $68.5K (Q1 2024 annualized) — a 11.1% improvement in productivity.

Additional year-over-year improvements:
- Customer acquisition cost (CAC) payback period: 14 months (down from 17 months in Q1 2024)
- Lifetime value to CAC ratio: 5.2x (up from 4.1x)
- Magic number (net new ARR / sales and marketing spend): 1.4 (up from 1.1)
- Rule of 40 score: 26.2% growth + 9.1% EBITDA margin = 35.3 (approaching the 40 threshold)

The Rule of 40 trajectory is particularly noteworthy. At current growth rates, the company is expected to cross the Rule of 40 threshold by Q3 2025, which would place Nextera in the top quartile of SaaS companies by this combined efficiency metric.

III. Q2 2025 OUTLOOK

Q2 revenue plan: $33.4M (+5.0% QoQ)
Q2 pipeline coverage: 3.6x (strong)
Q2 expected headcount: 440 (22 net adds, spring hiring push)

Key Q2 initiatives impacting financials:
- Axion integration beta launch (June): no direct revenue impact in Q2, but positions for H2 upsell revenue estimated at $2-4M incremental ARR by year-end. Beta participants (45 on waitlist) represent $6.8M in current ACV, providing a strong upsell base.
- Supply chain dashboard redesign GA: expected to drive 15-20 enterprise trial requests. Marketing campaign budget: $120K. Product team projecting 8-12% improvement in user engagement metrics.
- Customer conference (June 12-13, Moscone Center): $450K budget allocated. Expected attendance: 400-500 customers and prospects. Keynote from CEO, product roadmap showcase, and partner exhibition hall.
- SOC 2 Type II certification (audit in progress March 3-21): $85K audit cost, critical for enterprise pipeline. Six enterprise opportunities ($2.3M combined ACV) are contingent on SOC 2 Type II completion.
- Mobile app v2 beta: $180K development cost in Q2, targeting April launch. Customer research indicates 34% of users access the platform from mobile devices.
- 13th floor office buildout completion: $120K remaining Nextera contribution, occupancy March 1 (already commenced).

Q2 risk factors:
- Hiring pipeline: 22 net adds required to reach 440 headcount. Recruiter capacity is sufficient but competition for AI/ML engineers remains intense. Two Q1 engineering offers were declined due to competing offers from larger companies.
- Seasonal effect: Q2 is historically 3-5% below Q1 in bookings due to enterprise budget cycle timing. Pipeline coverage of 3.6x provides adequate buffer.
- Kinaxis competition: 8 customers evaluated or mentioned Kinaxis in Q1 NPS responses. Competitive pressure is manageable but requires continued product investment and customer success engagement.
