RECORDED STATEMENTS

The following statements were recorded during the session and are reproduced verbatim from the meeting notes and communications:

"Priya Deshmukh: 'This is the first joint sprint between Condor and Falcon. We have clear ownership boundaries — Condor owns the multi-tenant and Postgres work, Falcon owns Kafka and rec engine. We will sync daily at 9:15.'"

The speaker's remarks were acknowledged by the other participants present and no immediate counterpoints or clarifications were requested at the time the statement was made.

SUPPORTING DATA AND METRICS

The following quantitative data points and supporting details were presented or referenced during the session:

  * Sprint S20 risk register: Postgres runbook dependency on staging-large availability (Oct 11), Kafka KRaft security group change requires infra team approval (Olumide submitted change request), librdkafka upgrade may surface Avro deserialization differences (mitigation: shadow traffic comparison)

    This data point was verified against the source system records and confirmed as accurate by the presenting team member. The metric is tracked on a recurring basis and compared against historical baselines and organizational targets. Any variance from expected values has been noted and will be addressed through the appropriate operational channels.
