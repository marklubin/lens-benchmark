NEXTERA SOLUTIONS
PRODUCT PARTNERSHIP ANNOUNCEMENT

To: All Nextera Employees
From: Hannah Choi, VP Product
Date: January 30, 2025

I'm thrilled to announce that Nextera Solutions has signed a product partnership with Axion Labs to integrate their real-time logistics data into our analytics platform.

After a rigorous four-week technical evaluation, we have signed a 3-year commercial agreement with Axion Labs to bring their industry-leading real-time logistics data feed into the Nextera platform. This is a significant product investment that will give our customers access to the broadest and highest-quality logistics data available.

WHAT THIS MEANS

Axion Labs operates the most comprehensive real-time logistics data platform in the market. Their data feed covers 340+ shipping lanes globally — compared to our current coverage of 220 lanes. Their data is fresher (15-minute updates vs. 30 minutes from our current providers), more accurate (99.8% schema compliance), and faster to access (180ms average API latency vs. 290ms from our current provider).

This partnership is about one thing: giving our customers the best possible data for supply chain decision-making. Axion has the best real-time logistics data product on the market, period.

By integrating Axion's data into our platform, we will:
1. Expand shipping lane coverage by 55% (from 220 to 340+ lanes)
2. Improve data freshness by 2x across all logistics data dimensions
3. Enable real-time port congestion analytics for 340 ports globally
4. Provide vessel tracking data integrated with our recommendation engine
5. Deliver maritime weather overlays for route optimization

TIMELINE

The integration is underway. Here's the plan:

- Integration sprint: February 3 - February 28 (4 weeks, already started)
- Internal demo: February 28
- Customer beta launch: June 2025
- GA launch: September 2025

The integration team consists of 8 Nextera engineers plus 4 Axion engineers who will be working from our San Francisco office during the sprint. All 18 Axion API endpoints will be integrated into our analytics platform.

LEADERSHIP

Kai Brennan, CEO of Axion Labs, and I will be publishing a joint blog post next week announcing the partnership to the broader market. The press release has been distributed to supply chain trade publications and the embargo lifts February 3, 2025.

David Aldric: "This is exactly the kind of strategic product investment that defines Nextera. We partner to build, not to sell."

Kai Brennan: "Nextera is the clear leader in supply chain intelligence, and we're honored to bring our data to their platform. This partnership will create enormous value for the supply chain industry."

ABOUT AXION LABS

Axion Labs is a Series B startup headquartered in Austin, Texas. They have raised $45M in total funding and employ approximately 80 people. Their core product is a real-time logistics data platform that aggregates data from maritime AIS signals, port authorities, customs agencies, and satellite imagery to provide comprehensive shipping lane and port status data.

Their leadership team includes:
- Kai Brennan, CEO and co-founder (previously VP Data Products at FourKites)
- James Whitworth, CTO and co-founder (previously Principal Engineer at Amazon Logistics)
- Maria Santos, VP Business Development (previously Director at project44)

WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW

1. This is a product partnership, not a corporate transaction. Nextera and Axion Labs remain independent companies.
2. The integration will not require changes to any customer's existing Nextera deployment. The Axion data will be available as an additional data layer in the analytics platform.
3. Customers will be able to opt in to the Axion data features during the beta period. There may be a premium pricing tier for enhanced logistics data access — product and sales teams will finalize pricing by May.
4. The partnership commercial terms are a 3-year agreement with mutual renewal options.

INTEGRATION DETAILS

For those interested in the technical details, here's how the integration will work:

Architecture:
- Axion's API endpoints will be consumed by a dedicated Nextera microservice ("axion-ingestion-service")
- Real-time data flows through our existing Kafka infrastructure (topic: nextera.axion.logistics.raw)
- Data is processed by our standard ETL pipeline and stored in Snowflake for analytics
- Dashboard frontend will add new visualization components for the Axion data layers
- The recommendation engine v3 will be updated in a future release to incorporate Axion data as an input signal

Integration team (Nextera side):
- Tyler Kim (Platform Engineer, Lead)
- Raj Patel (Senior Engineer, API integration)
- Devi Krishnan (Data Engineer, data pipeline)
- Carlos Rivera (Software Engineer, backend services)
- Amara Williams (Senior Engineer, infrastructure)
- Fatima Al-Rashid (ML Engineer, data quality validation)
- Ethan Novak (Software Engineer, frontend dashboard)
- Grace Zhou (QA Engineer, testing)

Integration team (Axion side — visiting San Francisco Feb 3-28):
- Two backend engineers
- One data engineer
- One product manager

Sprint cadence:
- Week 1 (Feb 3-7): Core API connectivity, authentication, basic data flow
- Week 2 (Feb 10-14): Full endpoint integration (all 18 endpoints)
- Week 3 (Feb 17-21): Data quality validation, error handling, monitoring
- Week 4 (Feb 24-28): End-to-end testing, internal demo preparation

CUSTOMER IMPACT ASSESSMENT

Product marketing has conducted a preliminary assessment of customer impact:

- Estimated customer interest: 60-70% of enterprise customers will want access to the enhanced logistics data
- Upsell potential: $15-25/user/month premium for Axion data access (pricing TBD)
- Estimated incremental ARR from Axion features at full adoption: $4-6M/year
- Customer beta participants targeted: 30-40 accounts
- Customer beta waitlist (already expressed interest): 12 accounts

Competitive impact:
- Nextera will have the broadest logistics data coverage of any supply chain analytics platform in the market
- Kinaxis covers approximately 180 shipping lanes (vs. our new 340+)
- Palantir's data coverage varies by deployment but typically covers 200-250 lanes
- Blue Yonder relies on customer-provided data and does not have a native logistics data feed

This partnership positions Nextera as the clear data leader in our category. Product marketing will update all competitive battle cards by February 10.

PRESS AND MEDIA

Press release distributed to the following publications (embargo lifts February 3):
- Supply Chain Dive
- Logistics Management
- FreightWaves
- TechCrunch
- The Information
- Bloomberg (tech reporter)

Joint blog post (authored by Kai Brennan and Hannah Choi) publishing February 3 on both companies' blogs.

Social media coordination:
- Nextera LinkedIn post: February 3, 9 AM EST
- Nextera Twitter post: February 3, 9 AM EST
- Axion Labs will cross-post on their channels
- Employees are encouraged to share and engage with the posts

Just saw the Axion Labs partnership announcement! This is awesome — the data coverage expansion is going to be huge for our customers. :tada:

[10:08 AM] raj.patel
The engineering team has been working on this eval for 2 weeks and I can confirm the Axion data quality is legitimate. Their API is fast, their coverage is broad, and their engineering team is sharp. Excited to start the integration sprint.

[10:12 AM] tomas.lindgren
This is great news from a CS perspective. At least 6 of my enterprise accounts have been asking for broader shipping lane coverage. This directly addresses their top request.

[10:15 AM] carlos.rivera
wait is this a partnership or are we getting acquired :eyes:

[10:17 AM] ethan.novak
:eyes::eyes:

[10:19 AM] amara.williams
guys chill, it's a data integration partnership. not every partnership means M&A

[10:22 AM] kenji.tanaka
idk my friend at [redacted] said their "partnership" turned into an acquisition in 6 months...

[10:25 AM] devi.krishnan
genuine question: should we be worried about our equity if something happens?

[10:28 AM] grace.zhou
I think this is just a data deal. The announcement is very clear about it being a product partnership. Axion is a $45M Series B company — they're not buying us.

[10:31 AM] fatima.al-rashid
Also, David literally said at the all-hands 3 days ago that we're not for sale. And the announcement says "we partner to build, not to sell." Seems pretty clear.

[10:34 AM] carlos.rivera
fair points, fair points. I just get nervous when companies start doing "strategic partnerships" because I've seen that movie before :sweat_smile:

[10:38 AM] sami.okoro
Can we focus on the actual product here? The 340 shipping lane coverage is a 55% increase. That's going to open up entirely new customer segments for us — Southeast Asian logistics companies, African trade corridors, South American intra-regional routes. This is exciting from a product perspective.

[10:42 AM] ben.arujo
+1 to Sami. The customer advisory board loved the Axion data preview. 8 of 10 members said they'd upgrade their plan for access. This is a revenue growth opportunity.

[10:45 AM] lauren.sinclair
From the SDR perspective — this gives us a great new angle for outreach. "Real-time logistics data across 340+ shipping lanes" is a compelling value prop that our competitors can't match.

[10:48 AM] miguel.fernandez
For CS — when will customers start hearing about this? Do we have talking points ready?

[10:51 AM] ben.arujo
Press release embargo lifts February 3. Customer communications will go out the same day. Amanda's team is drafting the customer FAQ now. Hold off on proactive customer outreach until the talking points are distributed.

[10:55 AM] carlos.rivera
ok one more question and then I'll stop being paranoid — does anyone know what "ML" stands for on David's calendar? his EA posted about a dinner at Quince and the calendar entry said "ML — dinner"

[10:57 AM] raj.patel
machine learning? :thinking_face:

[10:59 AM] amara.williams
probably Marcus Lowe or something. David has dinner meetings all the time. Can we move on? :face_with_rolling_eyes:

HR reminder: Please avoid speculation about corporate transactions on public channels. If you have questions, reach out to your manager or HR directly.

This channel is for company-wide communication and community building. Speculation about M&A activity is not appropriate for this forum and can create unnecessary anxiety. If you have specific concerns about your equity or employment, please schedule a 1:1 with your manager or with any member of the HR team.

Thank you.

[11:05 AM] ben.arujo
Thanks Vanessa. Back to the product — the integration sprint kicks off Monday Feb 3 and we'll have 4 Axion engineers in the office for the first week. Please welcome them if you see them around!

[11:08 AM] carlos.rivera
will do! sorry for the speculation. genuinely excited about the partnership :thumbsup:

[11:12 AM] grace.zhou
Same. Let's ship something great.

[11:15 AM] diana.marsh
From the sales side — this partnership is going to be a massive competitive advantage. Kinaxis doesn't have real-time logistics data at this scale, and Palantir's data coverage is narrower than what Axion provides. We're going to win more deals because of this.

[11:18 AM] chris.nadal
100%. I just signed DB Schenker and one of their key asks was broader European shipping lane coverage. The Axion integration addresses that perfectly. I'm going to reach out to their VP of Digital to preview what's coming.

[11:21 AM] ben.arujo
@chris.nadal Hold on customer outreach until the press embargo lifts Feb 3 and the customer talking points are distributed. We want to be coordinated on this.

[11:24 AM] chris.nadal
Got it — will wait for the green light.

[11:28 AM] amanda.briggs
CS team — I'm drafting customer FAQ and talking points. They'll be ready by Feb 3. Key messages:
1. This is a product enhancement, not a change in service
2. No action required from customers
3. New logistics data features available in beta June 2025
4. Existing data feeds remain unchanged
5. Pricing for enhanced data features will be communicated in advance

Please wait for the official talking points before discussing with customers.

[11:32 AM] tomas.lindgren
Thanks Amanda. A few of my customers follow supply chain trade publications closely so they may ask about this as soon as the press release drops. Good to have the FAQ ready.

[11:35 AM] kevin.orosco
Sales team — this is a great opportunity for pipeline generation. I'm working with product marketing on updated pitch decks and competitive battle cards that incorporate the Axion data advantage. Expect new materials by Feb 10.

In the meantime, use the partnership announcement as a reason to reach out to prospects who stalled in Q4. "We just announced a major data partnership that addresses the logistics data gaps you mentioned" is a compelling re-engagement message.

[11:38 AM] owen.park
From finance — the partnership is a 3-year commercial agreement at $180K/year. Clean deal structure, well within our vendor budget. No unusual financial implications.

[11:42 AM] frank.gutierrez
Security note: the Axion integration will go through our standard security review process. I've already reviewed Axion's SOC 2 Type II report (clean opinion, issued November 2024) and their data processing agreement meets our requirements. Data flows will be encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256). No customer data will be shared with Axion.

[11:45 AM] raj.patel
@frank.gutierrez Good to know. The integration architecture uses our standard Kafka ingestion layer, so Axion data goes through the same security controls as all our other data sources. No special exceptions needed.

[11:48 AM] vanessa.kline

Subject: Vendor Contract Guidance — Updated Policy

Jordan, Angela,

Effective immediately, please do not approve any new vendor contracts or renewals with terms exceeding 18 months without my explicit written approval.

This applies to all vendor categories — infrastructure, software, professional services, facilities, and any other vendor commitments. The only exception is the AWS 3-year contract that was already executed on January 15 — that agreement is grandfathered.

Specific action items:

1. Jordan — update the renewal tracker to flag all contracts with terms over 18 months. I want to review each one individually. This includes contracts that are currently in negotiation (Snowflake, Datadog) and any that come up for renewal in the remainder of Q1 and Q2.

2. Angela — for any contracts currently in the approval pipeline that have terms exceeding 18 months, please hold them until I can review. Do not execute.

3. For contracts under 18 months, the existing approval workflow (manager → VP → CFO for >$100K) remains unchanged.

This is a financial discipline measure. We want maximum flexibility in our vendor commitments going forward. Please communicate this to your teams as a budgetary best practice.

A few specific notes:

Snowflake renewal: Currently structured as a 36-month term at 12% volume discount. This now requires my review before execution. Please pause the negotiation until I can assess whether we should restructure to a shorter term.

Datadog renewal: The 36-month commitment at 15% discount was approved by me before this policy change. However, given the new guidance, I'd like to re-evaluate the term length. Please reach out to the Datadog account team about restructuring to 18 months. We may lose the discount, but I want to understand the cost differential.

New vendor onboarding: Any new vendor contract should default to a 12-month term unless there is a compelling pricing justification for a longer commitment. All new vendor contracts over $50K/year require my review regardless of term length.

Effective date: January 30, 2025
Policy scope: All vendor contracts and renewals company-wide
Exception: AWS 3-year contract (already executed, grandfathered)

Additional context: I've been reviewing our vendor commitment profile as part of our overall financial strategy. Having long-term vendor commitments is generally good for pricing, but it reduces our flexibility. In a fast-moving market, I want us to have the ability to adjust our vendor mix quickly if our needs change.

This is not about any specific vendor relationship — it's a general financial discipline that I want to institutionalize across the organization. Many of our peer companies (I've benchmarked against 8 enterprise SaaS companies in our revenue range) have adopted similar policies, with maximum vendor commitment terms of 12-24 months.

The formal vendor management policy will include:

1. Maximum term: 18 months without CFO written approval
2. Preferred term: 12 months for all new vendor relationships
3. Exception process: written request to CFO with justification for longer terms (e.g., significant pricing benefit, strategic importance)
4. Renewal review: all renewals >$50K require finance team review 60 days before expiration
5. Contract flexibility: all new contracts should include a termination for convenience clause with 90-day notice
6. Assignability: all new contracts should include an assignability clause allowing Nextera to assign the contract to an affiliate or successor entity

On the assignability clause specifically — this is a standard enterprise SaaS best practice. Nathan Foley in legal has confirmed that our standard vendor contract template already includes this language, but about 30% of our existing contracts were signed using vendor paper and may not have it. I'd like Nathan to do a spot-check on our top 20 vendor contracts to verify assignability provisions are in place.

I'll update the formal vendor management policy document on the intranet by end of week. In the meantime, please treat this email as the operative guidance.

Subject: RE: Vendor Contract Guidance — Updated Policy

Priya,

Quick follow-up: I ran a preliminary analysis of the financial impact of restructuring our top vendor commitments to shorter terms.

Impact analysis — switching from 36-month to 12-month terms on major vendors:

Vendor          Current Term    Current Discount    12-month Discount    Annual Cost Increase
Snowflake       36-month        12%                 0%                   $252K
Datadog         36-month        15%                 3%                   $72K
MongoDB         24-month        8%                  3%                   $12K
Confluent       24-month        6%                  0%                   $10.8K
LaunchDarkly    24-month        10%                 0%                   $9.6K
Others (8)      Various         Various             Various              ~$40K

Total estimated annual cost increase from term restructuring: ~$396K

For perspective, $396K per year is approximately 0.4% of our total operating expense budget. The flexibility benefit may justify this cost, but I want to make sure you have the full picture.

Also noting: the termination for convenience clause and the assignability clause are important additions to our standard terms. I'll work with Nathan Foley to ensure these are included in all ongoing and future negotiations.

CC: Angela Torres <a.torres@nextera.io>
Subject: RE: Vendor Contract Guidance — Updated Policy

Priya,

Understood. I'll update the renewal tracker today to flag all contracts with terms exceeding 18 months. Quick question: for the Snowflake renewal, we had verbal agreement with their enterprise team on the 36-month / 12% discount structure. If we restructure to 12 or 18 months, we'll likely lose the full 12% discount. Snowflake typically offers:

- 12-month term: 0% discount (standard pricing)
- 18-month term: 5-7% discount
- 24-month term: 8-10% discount
- 36-month term: 12-15% discount

At our current Snowflake spend of $2.1M/year, the difference between a 12-month term (0% discount) and the 36-month term (12% discount) is approximately $252K/year. Over 3 years, that's $756K in additional cost.

Do you want me to proceed with the shorter term despite the cost increase, or should we discuss?

Jordan

Subject: RE: Vendor Contract Guidance — Updated Policy

Jordan,

I understand the cost implications. Let's aim for 12 months on Snowflake. The flexibility is worth the cost increase. We can negotiate harder on the discount for a 12-month term — try for 5% given our usage volume and growth trajectory. If they won't budge below list price for 12 months, see if 18 months with a 7% discount is achievable.

Angela — same analysis for Datadog please. What's the cost differential between 18 months and 36 months?

For context, approximately 34 of our current vendor contracts have terms exceeding 18 months. I want to see the full list with contract values and expiration dates by end of week. We'll triage them together on Monday.

The goal is maximum flexibility in our vendor commitments. I know it costs more in some cases, but the optionality is valuable.

Subject: RE: Vendor Contract Guidance — Updated Policy

Priya,

Datadog analysis:

Current negotiation: 36-month term at 15% discount = $510K/year ($0.6M list - 15%)
18-month option: estimated 8% discount = $552K/year
12-month option: estimated 3% discount = $582K/year

Annual cost increase vs. 36-month term:
- 18-month: +$42K/year
- 12-month: +$72K/year

I'll pull the full list of 34 contracts over 18 months by Friday. Preliminary scan shows the following major ones:

1. AWS: 3-year term ($4.2M/year) — grandfathered
2. Snowflake: 36-month under negotiation ($2.1M/year) — being restructured per your guidance
3. Datadog: 36-month under negotiation ($0.6M/year) — being restructured
4. MongoDB Atlas: 24-month ($0.24M/year) — renews March
5. Confluent: 24-month ($0.18M/year) — renews February
6. Several smaller vendors with 24-month terms (combined $0.8M/year)

New policy compliance once fully implemented: approximately 89% of active contracts would be under 18 months. The remaining 11% would be the grandfathered AWS contract and any exceptions you approve.

Updated status:
- Snowflake: negotiation paused, being restructured from 36-month to 12-month term per CFO guidance
- Datadog: negotiation paused, being restructured from 36-month to 18-month term per CFO guidance
- All other vendor renewals proceeding under the new 18-month maximum term policy

VII. KEY METRICS

ARR (end of January): $119.5M (up from $118.7M at year-end)
Customer count: 219 (net +1 in January)
Net revenue retention (trailing 12 months): 119%
Gross revenue retention (trailing 12 months): 94%
Gross margin: 78.4%
EBITDA: -$0.8M (improvement from -$1.0M in December)
Cash runway: ~24 months at current burn
Pipeline coverage: 3.2x

Preliminary close numbers are subject to standard month-end adjustments. Final January close report will be distributed by February 7.

VIII. Q1 FORECAST UPDATE

The forecast improvement is driven by January's outperformance carrying forward into February and March expectations. Pipeline coverage remains strong at 3.2x and sales velocity has been healthy. No material risks identified that would cause Q1 to underperform the updated forecast.

Collections in January were strong — we collected $8.4M against $7.8M expected. The DSO improvement from 42 to 40 days reflects the finance team's focus on collections efficiency. Angela Torres implemented a new automated dunning process in December that is producing results.

Breakdown:

- Testing infrastructure (load testing hardware for K8s migration): $0.06M

Year-to-date capex: $0.4M of $12.6M annual budget (3.2%)

The K8s infrastructure spend will accelerate in February during the production migration, with estimated February capex of $0.8-1.0M primarily for the EKS production cluster and related networking infrastructure.

XII. DEFERRED REVENUE

Deferred revenue balance end of January: $23.4M (up from $22.8M at year-end)

The increase of $0.6M reflects:
- New annual prepaid contracts signed in January: +$1.2M
- Revenue recognition against existing deferred: -$0.6M

Deferred revenue provides strong revenue visibility. Approximately 65% of projected Q1 revenue is already contracted and sitting in deferred revenue, compared to 58% at this point last year. This is a direct result of our shift toward annual and multi-year prepaid enterprise contracts.

Deferred revenue breakdown by term:
- 1-year prepaid: $14.2M (60.7%)
- 2-year prepaid: $6.8M (29.1%)
- 3-year prepaid: $2.4M (10.3%)

The 3-year prepaid contracts represent our largest and most committed enterprise customers, including GlobalShip Partners, LogiFlow Inc., and the recently signed Kuehne+Nagel deal.

XIII. BOARD PACKAGE READINESS

The January board package will include:
1. This financial flash report (to be finalized as the formal January close report by Feb 7)
2. Updated revenue waterfall model (in progress)
3. Sales pipeline and quota attainment summary
4. Customer health dashboard

Target distribution to board members: February 3, 2025 (one week before the February 10 board meeting).

Jordan — please verify that the revenue waterfall model includes the Axion partnership cost impact ($180K/year starting in FY2025). It's a new vendor cost that needs to be reflected in the P&L forecast.

Angela — please verify that the Axion Labs commercial agreement has been recorded as a vendor commitment in our contract tracking system and that the first payment is properly accrued.
