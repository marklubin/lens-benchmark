NEXTERA SOLUTIONS — INTERNAL MEMORANDUM
SUBJECT: Floor 5 Sublease Opportunity Assessment
FROM: Rachel Kim, Office Manager
TO: Nathan Ellis (CFO), General Counsel, Facilities Committee
DATE: September 29, 2025
CLASSIFICATION: Internal — Confidential

1. PURPOSE

This memorandum presents an analysis of the sublease opportunity for Floor 5 of Nextera Solutions' headquarters at 500 Terry Francois Blvd, San Francisco, CA. The analysis was prompted by the sustained low utilization of Floor 5 since the company implemented its hybrid work policy in January 2025. This memo provides utilization data, a financial analysis of the sublease option, preliminary market assessments from CBRE Group (Nextera's commercial real estate broker), and a recommendation for next steps including a legal review of the master lease sublease provisions.

2. REFERENCED ENTITIES

    Rachel Kim, Office Manager — memo author, responsible for facilities management, space planning, and vendor coordination for all Nextera office locations.

    Nathan Ellis, CFO — memo recipient, budget authority for the sublease decision. Nathan's approval is required for any lease modification or sublease arrangement that materially changes Nextera's real estate cost structure.

    CBRE Group — Nextera's commercial real estate broker. CBRE has served as Nextera's broker since the original headquarters lease was signed in 2021 and is familiar with the property, the landlord, and the Mission Bay submarket dynamics.

    Nextera HQ — 500 Terry Francois Blvd, San Francisco, CA. The headquarters occupies floors 2 through 6 of the building, totaling 62,000 square feet of rentable office space.

    Mission Bay Properties LLC — the landlord for 500 Terry Francois Blvd. Mission Bay Properties is a San Francisco-based commercial real estate firm that owns and manages several Class A office buildings in the Mission Bay neighborhood.

3. CURRENT SPACE UTILIZATION ANALYSIS

3.1 Overall Office Footprint

Nextera Solutions currently leases 62,000 square feet across floors 2 through 6 at 500 Terry Francois Blvd. The space is configured as follows:

    Floor 2: Reception, main conference center (4 large rooms, 2 boardrooms), all-hands space, visitor area. Total: 12,400 sq ft.
    Floor 3: Engineering (front-end, platform, and data teams). Open floor plan with 120 workstations, 6 huddle rooms, 2 phone booths. Total: 12,400 sq ft.
    Floor 4: Engineering (infrastructure, SRE, and QA teams) and Product. Open floor plan with 110 workstations, 8 huddle rooms, 1 dedicated war room. Total: 12,400 sq ft.
    Floor 5: Sales, Marketing, and Business Development. Open floor plan with 95 workstations, 4 huddle rooms, 2 phone booths, 1 demo room. Total: 12,400 sq ft.
    Floor 6: Executive offices, Finance, Legal, HR, and IT. Mixed configuration with 15 private offices, 60 open workstations, 3 meeting rooms. Total: 12,400 sq ft.

Total office footprint: 62,000 sq ft.

3.2 Headcount and Hybrid Policy Context

Nextera Solutions current headcount is 398 employees. Of these, approximately 340 are classified as office-eligible, meaning they are expected to work from the San Francisco headquarters at least part of the time. The remaining 58 employees are designated full-remote and are distributed across 14 states. The hybrid work policy, which took effect on January 6, 2025, requires office-eligible employees to be in the office a minimum of 2 days per week. Employees may choose which 2 days they attend, subject to team-level coordination for collaboration days and meeting-heavy periods.

3.3 Floor 5 Utilization Data

Floor 5 utilization has been tracked since the hybrid policy took effect using badge swipe data from the building access control system and supplemented by desk booking data from the Robin space management platform. The data covers the period January 6 through September 26, 2025, representing 38 complete workweeks.

Key utilization metrics for Floor 5:

    Average daily occupancy: 36 of 95 workstations occupied (37.9%)
    Peak daily occupancy: 62 workstations (65.3%), observed on Wednesdays during pipeline review weeks
    Minimum daily occupancy: 11 workstations (11.6%), observed on Fridays
    Overall weekly average occupancy since January 2025: 38.0% of available workstations across all five workdays
    Quarterly trend: Q1 2025 average 42%, Q2 2025 average 39%, Q3 2025 average 34% through September 26

The departments housed on Floor 5 — Sales, Marketing, and Business Development — have the lowest in-office attendance rates at Nextera. Sales representatives travel approximately 40% of business days for customer meetings and conferences. Marketing staff report that content creation, campaign management, and design work are more productive from home offices. The Business Development team has members distributed across Pacific, Central, and Eastern time zones, making synchronous in-office work less practical.

The declining utilization trend (42% in Q1 to 34% in Q3) reflects the natural settling of attendance patterns after the initial hybrid policy rollout, as employees optimized their in-office schedules to the minimum two-day requirement.

3.4 Comparison with Other Floors

For context, utilization rates for the other workstation-based floors:
    Floor 3 (Engineering): 71.2% average daily occupancy
    Floor 4 (Engineering/Product): 68.4% average daily occupancy
    Floor 6 (Executive/Admin): 55.8% average daily occupancy

Engineering's higher attendance reflects pair programming practices, hardware lab access, and cultural norms favoring in-person collaboration. Floor 6 attendance is driven by executive preference for in-person meetings and Finance's in-office requirements during monthly and quarterly close periods.

4. SUBLEASE FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

4.1 Current Floor 5 Lease Cost

Floor 5 is part of the master lease for floors 2 through 6 at 500 Terry Francois Blvd. The lease rate is $50 per square foot per year, applied uniformly across all five floors. The Floor 5 annual lease cost is:

    12,400 sq ft x $50/sq ft = $620,000 per year

The current lease term expires on June 30, 2027, leaving 21 months remaining from the date of this memo. The total remaining lease obligation attributable to Floor 5 is approximately $1,085,000 (21 months of the $620,000 annual cost).

4.2 Sublease Market Assessment

CBRE Group provided a preliminary market assessment for sublease space in the Mission Bay submarket of San Francisco. The assessment was conducted during the week of September 22, 2025, and is based on recent comparable sublease transactions, current sublease listings, and CBRE's proprietary demand pipeline data.

Key findings from CBRE's assessment:

    Comparable sublease asking rates in Mission Bay: $4.15 to $4.50 per square foot per month for Class A office space in move-in ready condition. The range reflects variations in floor plate configuration, views, building amenities, and remaining sublease term.

    At the midpoint of the range ($4.33/sq ft/month), a sublease of Floor 5 (12,400 sq ft) would generate approximately $53,692 per month, or $644,300 annualized.

    Current Mission Bay sublease vacancy rate: 18.2%, which is down from 22.4% in Q1 2025. The declining vacancy rate indicates moderate and improving demand for sublease space in the submarket. CBRE attributes the improvement to several biotech and life sciences companies expanding their administrative office footprints in Mission Bay, complementing their lab space in the neighborhood.

    Average time to sublease for comparable spaces: 4 to 6 months from initial listing to lease execution. This timeline includes marketing, tenant showings, letter of intent negotiation, lease documentation, and landlord consent processing.

    CBRE identified two potential sublease tenants currently in their pipeline seeking 10,000 to 15,000 sq ft in Mission Bay. The first is a mid-stage biotech company expanding its administrative and commercial team. The second is a professional services firm opening a San Francisco satellite office. Neither tenant has been formally introduced to Nextera's space opportunity.

Rachel Kim provided the following assessment: "We're paying $50/sq ft annually for space that's mostly empty three days a week. The sublease math is compelling even with broker fees and tenant improvement allowances. — Rachel Kim"

4.3 Cost Considerations

The sublease financial analysis must account for several costs that reduce the net benefit:

    Broker Commission: CBRE's sublease brokerage commission is 4% of the total sublease value over the sublease term. For an illustrative 15-month sublease at $53,692/month, the commission would be approximately $32,215.

    Tenant Improvement Allowance: Depending on the sublease tenant's requirements, Nextera may need to provide a tenant improvement (TI) allowance for modifications to the space. CBRE provided a range estimate: $0 (if the tenant accepts the space in its current configuration, which is possible given the modern open-plan buildout completed in 2021) to $200,000 (if the tenant requires substantial modifications such as demising walls to create separate suites, separate HVAC zoning for after-hours access, dedicated server room buildout, or independent IT infrastructure).

    Furniture and Equipment: Floor 5 is currently furnished with 95 sit-stand workstations (Herman Miller), 95 ergonomic task chairs, 4 huddle room furniture sets, phone booth pods, and the demo room equipment. Options include: (a) include furniture in the sublease at no additional charge, which is attractive to tenants and avoids storage costs; (b) remove furniture and store at a commercial storage facility at an estimated cost of $2,800 per month; or (c) sell furniture on the secondary market (estimated recovery value: $25,000-$40,000 for the full set).

    Relocation of Floor 5 Employees: The approximately 36 employees who regularly use Floor 5 workstations on any given day would need to be accommodated on other floors. Based on current utilization data, Floor 3 has approximately 20 unused workstations on peak days, and Floor 6 has approximately 15 unused workstations. Hot-desking or desk-sharing arrangements would need to be implemented, and some employees may need to adjust their in-office days to avoid crowding on Wednesdays.

Nathan Ellis, CFO, raised the following concern: "I want to see the analysis with full buildout costs. If we need to spend $200K on demising walls and separate HVAC, the payback period changes significantly. — Nathan Ellis"

4.4 Financial Summary — Three Scenarios

    Scenario A (Tenant accepts space as-is, no TI, furniture included):
    Gross sublease revenue (15 months at $53,692): $805,380
    Less broker commission (4%): ($32,215)
    Net benefit: $773,165
    Payback period: Immediate (no upfront costs).

    Scenario B (Moderate TI of $100,000, furniture included):
    Gross sublease revenue (15 months at $53,692): $805,380
    Less broker commission (4%): ($32,215)
    Less TI allowance: ($100,000)
    Net benefit: $673,165
    Payback period: Approximately 2 months of sublease revenue covers the TI.

    Scenario C (Full TI of $200,000, furniture removal and storage):
    Gross sublease revenue (15 months at $53,692): $805,380
    Less broker commission (4%): ($32,215)
    Less TI allowance: ($200,000)
    Less furniture storage (15 months at $2,800): ($42,000)
    Net benefit: $531,165
    Payback period: Approximately 4.5 months of sublease revenue covers the TI and storage costs.

All three scenarios produce positive outcomes that offset a substantial portion of the remaining $1,085,000 lease obligation for Floor 5.

5. LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS

The master lease for 500 Terry Francois Blvd contains sublease provisions in Article 14 that must be reviewed by General Counsel before Nextera can proceed. Key provisions include:

    Section 14.2 (Landlord Consent): Requires written landlord consent for any sublease of a full floor or more. The provision states that consent "shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed" and that the landlord has 30 calendar days to respond to a sublease consent request.

    Section 14.3 (Recapture Right): Grants the landlord the right to recapture the subleased space — meaning the landlord may elect to terminate the applicable portion of the master lease and lease directly to the proposed subtenant. This right is exercisable within 15 days of receiving the sublease consent request. If the landlord exercises the recapture right, Nextera's lease obligation for Floor 5 terminates, which would be a favorable outcome (it eliminates the $620,000/year obligation entirely without the complexity of managing a sublease).

    Section 14.5 (Profit Sharing): Requires that any sublease profit (sublease revenue exceeding Nextera's pro-rata lease cost, after deduction of reasonable brokerage commissions and TI costs) be shared 50/50 between Nextera and the landlord.

General Counsel is requested to review these provisions in detail, assess the landlord's likely response, and advise on the optimal strategy. A preliminary legal review is requested by October 10, 2025.

6. RECOMMENDATION AND NEXT STEPS

    (a) General Counsel to complete legal review of sublease provisions by October 10, 2025.
    (b) CBRE to prepare formal sublease marketing package and timeline, contingent on legal review.
    (c) Rachel Kim to develop Floor 5 employee relocation plan with Sales, Marketing, and BD department heads.
    (d) Full analysis presentation to the Facilities Committee at its October 15 meeting for go/no-go decision.

The Facilities Committee and CFO are requested to review this memo and provide feedback by October 3, 2025.

NEXTERA SOLUTIONS — PCI DSS v4.0 GAP ASSESSMENT
NEXTERA PAYMENT PROCESSING ENVIRONMENT
Prepared by: Priya Mehta, Director of Information Security
Date: September 29, 2025
Distribution: InfoSec Team, Finance, General Counsel
Document Classification: Internal — Restricted

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents the findings of Nextera Solutions' initial gap assessment against the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard version 4.0 (PCI DSS v4.0). The assessment was conducted internally by the Information Security team with advisory input expected from Coalfire Systems, Nextera's Qualified Security Assessor (QSA), at a session scheduled for October 8. The purpose is to identify new PCI DSS v4.0 requirements applicable to Nextera's payment processing environment and to develop remediation plans for any gaps.

Nextera Solutions qualifies as a SAQ A-EP (Self-Assessment Questionnaire A-EP) merchant, a classification that applies to e-commerce merchants that partially outsource payment processing to a PCI-compliant third-party service provider. Nextera uses Stripe as its payment processor, and Stripe is a PCI Level 1 service provider. Nextera confirmed that it never stores, processes, or transmits cardholder data directly — all card data handling occurs within Stripe's infrastructure.

The assessment identified four new PCI DSS v4.0 requirements requiring implementation. The estimated engineering effort for full compliance is 3 to 4 sprints, or approximately 6 to 8 weeks of development and testing.

2. REFERENCED ENTITIES AND COMPLIANCE FRAMEWORK

    Priya Mehta, Director of Information Security — report author and PCI compliance program owner.

    Stripe — Nextera's payment processor and PCI DSS Level 1 service provider. Stripe handles all card data storage, processing, and transmission for transactions initiated through the Nextera billing portal. Stripe's current Attestation of Compliance (AOC) is dated April 2025, validated by an independent QSA.

    Coalfire Systems — Nextera's Qualified Security Assessor (QSA), retained to provide advisory services on SAQ type determination, self-assessment approach validation, and evidence preparation. Coalfire has served as Nextera's PCI advisory QSA since 2023.

    PCI DSS v4.0 — the current version of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. Version 4.0 was published by the PCI Security Standards Council with an effective date of March 31, 2024. The transition period for newly introduced requirements ended March 31, 2025, after which all v4.0 requirements became mandatory.

    Nextera billing portal (billing.nextera.io) — the customer-facing web application through which customers view invoices, manage payment methods, and submit payments. The portal uses Stripe Elements (embedded JavaScript components) to render payment form fields within an iframe hosted on Stripe's domain.

3. PAYMENT PROCESSING ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

Nextera's payment architecture minimizes PCI scope through delegation to Stripe:

    (a) Customer accesses the billing portal at billing.nextera.io.
    (b) The billing page loads Stripe Elements JavaScript from js.stripe.com. Stripe Elements renders card input fields (number, expiration, CVV) inside a Stripe-hosted iframe.
    (c) Card data entered by the customer flows directly from the Stripe iframe to Stripe's servers. No card data transits Nextera's servers, application code, or network infrastructure.
    (d) Stripe returns a payment token to Nextera's billing application, which uses the token to create or confirm a payment intent through Stripe's server-side API.
    (e) Nextera receives confirmation from Stripe and records the payment status, amount, date, and truncated card reference (last four digits) in the billing database. No full card data is stored.

Annual payment volume through Stripe: $118 million across approximately 4,200 transactions per month. Transactions are concentrated in the first week of each quarter when enterprise customers process annual and quarterly subscription renewals.

4. IDENTIFIED GAPS — PCI DSS v4.0 NEW REQUIREMENTS

Priya Mehta provided the following summary: "Our PCI exposure is minimal because of the Stripe architecture, but v4.0 adds requirements around the payment page itself — JavaScript integrity, CSP headers, that sort of thing. We need engineering cycles for that. — Priya Mehta"

4.1 Requirement 12.3.2 — Targeted Risk Analysis for Customized Controls

PCI DSS v4.0 mandates a documented targeted risk analysis for any control implemented via a customized approach rather than the defined approach. Nextera uses the defined approach for all applicable controls except log retention (Requirement 10.7), where Nextera retains payment-related logs for 18 months versus the 12-month minimum. Although Nextera's approach exceeds the standard, v4.0 requires a formal risk analysis document justifying the customization.

Gap: No formal targeted risk analysis exists for this customization.
Remediation: Create the risk analysis document, submit for QSA review.
Estimated Effort: 2-3 days.

4.2 Requirement 6.4.3 — Payment Page Script Inventory and Authorization

PCI DSS v4.0 requires that all scripts loaded and executed on payment pages in the consumer's browser be inventoried, authorized, justified for business need, and verified for integrity. This addresses Magecart-style script injection attacks.

Current State: The billing portal payment page loads: Stripe.js (from js.stripe.com), Google Analytics (from googletagmanager.com), Nextera's application JavaScript bundle (from billing.nextera.io), and a cookie consent script (from cookiebot.com). A manual script inventory exists in application documentation, but there is no automated mechanism to detect unauthorized script additions, verify script integrity at runtime, or alert on unexpected script sources.

Gap: Need automated script inventory validation, subresource integrity (SRI) tags on all scripts, and a reporting mechanism for Content-Security-Policy violations on the payment page.
Estimated Effort: 2 sprints (4 weeks).

4.3 Requirement 11.3.1.1 — Authenticated Internal Vulnerability Scanning

PCI DSS v4.0 requires that internal vulnerability scans use authentication (credentialed scanning) for comprehensive vulnerability detection. Nextera currently performs weekly unauthenticated internal scans via Qualys across the billing portal servers, API gateway, and billing database servers.

Gap: Need to configure credentialed scanning by creating dedicated scanning service accounts, updating Qualys scan policies, and validating scan accuracy.
Estimated Effort: 1 sprint (2 weeks).

4.4 Requirement 6.4.2 — Automated Script Integrity Monitoring

PCI DSS v4.0 requires an automated technical solution to detect and alert on unauthorized changes to HTTP headers and payment page content at runtime. This complements Requirement 6.4.3 by adding continuous monitoring.

Current State: No runtime script integrity monitoring exists. CSP headers are configured on 72% of billing portal pages; the remaining 28% use deprecated X-Content-Security-Policy headers or have no CSP. Payment pages have CSP in report-only mode — violations are logged but scripts are not blocked.

Gap: Implement enforcing CSP with report-to directives, script hash or nonce-based validation, and an alerting pipeline for runtime integrity violations.
Estimated Effort: 1.5 sprints (3 weeks), with overlap with Requirement 6.4.3.

5. COALFIRE ADVISORY SESSION

Coalfire Systems advisory session scheduled for October 8, 2025. Scope includes:

    (a) Validation of SAQ A-EP classification given current architecture.
    (b) Review of the four gap remediation plans.
    (c) Assessment of whether additional v4.0 requirements apply.
    (d) Documentation guidance for annual SAQ submission.

Engagement fee: $22,000 (fixed fee, up to 40 advisory hours).

6. REMEDIATION TIMELINE

    Sprint 1 (Oct 13-25): Requirement 12.3.2 (risk analysis) + Requirement 11.3.1.1 (authenticated scanning).
    Sprint 2 (Oct 27 - Nov 7): Requirements 6.4.2 + 6.4.3, Phase 1 (CSP implementation, script inventory).
    Sprint 3 (Nov 10-21): Requirements 6.4.2 + 6.4.3, Phase 2 (runtime monitoring, alerting, production rollout).
    Sprint 4 (Nov 24 - Dec 5): Validation, documentation, QSA evidence review.

Resource: 1.5 FTE for 8 weeks (1 senior engineer, 0.5 SRE).
Target completion: December 5, 2025.
Updated SAQ A-EP submission: December 2025.

EMAIL THREAD: IT ASSET LIFECYCLE — Q3 HARDWARE REFRESH PLAN

---

From: Diana Rosales <drosales@nextera.io>
To: James Whitfield <jwhitfield@nextera.io>, Rachel Kim <rkim@nextera.io>
Cc: Procurement <procurement@nextera.io>
Date: September 25, 2025, 9:14 AM PT
Subject: IT Asset Lifecycle — Q3 Hardware Refresh Plan

Hi James, Rachel,

Following up from last week's IT planning discussion. I've completed the asset lifecycle analysis using Jamf Pro inventory data and wanted to share findings and a proposed refresh plan for your review.

CURRENT INVENTORY OVERVIEW

Total IT asset inventory managed through Jamf Pro:
    — 412 laptops (MacBook Pro and MacBook Air models)
    — 38 external monitors (LG UltraWide 34" and Dell UltraSharp 27")
    — 12 conference room AV systems (Zoom Rooms hardware kits with PTZ cameras, speakerphones, and scheduling displays)

Average laptop age across the fleet: 2.8 years. Our standard lifecycle target for laptops is 4 years, after which machines are eligible for replacement regardless of current functional status. This lifecycle target balances hardware reliability, performance for current software requirements, Apple's security patching support window, and total cost of ownership including maintenance and lost productivity.

Jamf Pro license cost: $14 per device per month across 412 managed devices = $69,216 per year. The license covers MDM enrollment, remote management, software deployment and patching, compliance policy enforcement, and inventory reporting.

UNITS EXCEEDING 4-YEAR LIFECYCLE THRESHOLD

I've identified 67 MacBook Pro units that have exceeded or will exceed the 4-year lifecycle threshold by the end of Q3 2025. These units were originally provisioned and deployed between June and September 2021 during the company's last major hardware refresh cycle, and they all run Apple M1 or M1 Pro processors. The breakdown by department:

    Engineering: 41 units
    Sales: 18 units
    G&A (Finance, Legal, HR, IT, Office Management): 8 units

BATTERY HEALTH DATA FROM JAMF

Jamf Pro collects battery cycle count and health percentage from each managed device. Among the 67 units flagged for replacement:

    14 units: battery health below 60% of original design capacity. These units experience noticeable performance issues when running on battery — thermal throttling, unexpected shutdowns below 20% indicated charge, and reduced maximum screen brightness. Several engineers have reported needing to keep these machines plugged in at all times.
    28 units: battery health between 60% and 75%. Functional but reduced runtime (approximately 4-5 hours versus 10+ hours when new).
    25 units: battery health above 75%. These units are still performing adequately on battery but are approaching the end of their useful life based on the 4-year age threshold.

The 14 units with the most degraded batteries should be prioritized in the first wave of replacements, as they represent the most acute productivity impact.

Subject: RE: IT Asset Lifecycle — Q3 Hardware Refresh Plan

Diana,

Thanks for putting this together. The numbers confirm what my team leads have been telling me for months. Let me add some Engineering-specific context.

"Some of these machines are still on M1 chips and can't run the latest Xcode efficiently. The engineers have been patient but we're losing productivity. — James Whitfield"

The M1 to M4 performance gap is significant for our workflows:

    1. Xcode builds: The main application target takes approximately 14 minutes on M1 versus 6 minutes on current-generation hardware. Our engineers typically do 8-12 full builds per day during active development, so the delta adds up to roughly 60-90 minutes of waiting per engineer per day.

    2. Docker containers: Our local development environment runs 6 containerized services (PostgreSQL, Redis, API server, background worker, front-end dev server, and mock payment gateway). Starting the full stack takes 4.5 minutes on M1 versus under 2 minutes on M3/M4 hardware. Engineers restart the stack 3-5 times per day.

    3. Memory pressure: The 41 Engineering M1 units all have 16GB of unified memory. Running the full Docker stack alongside Xcode, Chrome (with 15+ tabs for Jira, Confluence, Slack web, API docs), and a database GUI consistently pushes memory utilization above 95%, triggering swap usage and visible UI lag. Several engineers have resorted to closing applications between tasks rather than running everything concurrently.

    4. Three engineers on the platform team have been using personal M3 MacBooks for development because their work-issued M1 units cannot handle the workload. This creates a CrowdStrike compliance gap since those personal machines are not enrolled in the BYOD program.

I fully support the phased rollout starting with Engineering in October. For the Engineering replacement units, I'd advocate for the MacBook Pro 14-inch with M4 Pro chip and 36GB unified memory rather than the base M4 with 24GB. The additional memory headroom would prevent the same problem from recurring in 2-3 years as our development environments continue to grow.

Subject: RE: IT Asset Lifecycle — Q3 Hardware Refresh Plan

James,

Good points on the RAM configuration. I'll work with Procurement to get an updated CDW quote for the M4 Pro / 36GB spec for Engineering units. Here's what we have so far:

CURRENT CDW QUOTE

CDW (our authorized Apple Business reseller) provided a quote for 67 MacBook Pro M4 units at the standard configuration:

    MacBook Pro 14-inch, Apple M4 chip, 24GB unified memory, 512GB SSD
    3-year AppleCare+ for Business coverage
    Apple Business Manager enrollment and zero-touch Jamf deployment
    Price per unit: $2,345
    Total: 67 units x $2,345 = $157,115

I'll request the M4 Pro / 36GB quote for the 41 Engineering units. The typical price delta is $400-$500 per unit, which would add approximately $16,400-$20,500 to the Engineering subset. I expect to have the revised quote by Monday.

BUDGET CONTEXT

Annual IT hardware budget: $280,000.
Year-to-date spend (through end of Q3): $98,400, consisting primarily of monitor replacements ($22,000), new hire laptop provisioning ($61,400 for 26 units), and conference room equipment repairs ($15,000).
Remaining budget: $181,600.

The base quote of $157,115 fits within the remaining budget. Even with the M4 Pro upgrade for the 41 Engineering units (estimated additional $16,400-$20,500), the total of approximately $173,500-$177,600 remains within the $181,600 available.

"Jamf shows 14 of the 67 units have battery health below 60%. Those should be prioritized in the October wave. — Diana Rosales"

PROPOSED PHASED ROLLOUT SCHEDULE

To manage the IT support workload and minimize disruption to each department, I recommend a three-wave rollout:

    Wave 1 — October 2025: Engineering (41 units)
    The 14 units with battery health below 60% will be replaced first during the week of October 6. The remaining 27 Engineering units will be replaced during the weeks of October 13 and October 20, in coordination with sprint boundaries to minimize development disruption. IT will schedule replacements for Monday mornings or Friday afternoons when possible, aligning with natural breaks in the engineering workflow.

    Wave 2 — November 2025: Sales (18 units)
    Sales replacements will be coordinated around the Q4 sales calendar. Early November (before Thanksgiving week and the end-of-quarter push) is the preferred window. Target dates: November 3-14.

    Wave 3 — December 2025: G&A (8 units)
    The smallest wave. Finance units will be scheduled after the November monthly close. Legal, HR, IT, and Office Management units will be replaced on a rolling basis during December at each employee's convenience.

Each replacement includes a 48-hour overlap period where the employee retains both old and new machines. New machines will be pre-configured through Apple Business Manager and Jamf Pro with all required software: Slack, Zoom, Chrome, CrowdStrike Falcon, Okta Verify, 1Password, Microsoft Office, and department-specific tools (Xcode and Docker Desktop for Engineering, Salesforce and Gong for Sales, QuickBooks for Finance). Target setup time from first boot to productive use: under 30 minutes.

DISPOSITION OF REPLACED UNITS

    Step 1 — Data Sanitization: All 67 replaced units will be sanitized per NIST SP 800-88 Revision 1 guidelines. For Apple Silicon Macs with SSDs, the approved method is the "Erase All Content and Settings" function, which performs a cryptographic erase of the hardware encryption key, rendering all data on the internal SSD unrecoverable without requiring a full disk overwrite.

    Step 2 — Iron Mountain Processing: After software-based sanitization, units are sent to Iron Mountain, Nextera's contracted IT asset disposition (ITAD) vendor. Iron Mountain performs physical verification of the sanitization, issues a certificate of destruction for each unit, and assesses whether the unit is functional enough for reuse. Cost: $18 per unit = $1,206 for 67 units.

    Step 3 — Donation or Recycling: Units that pass Iron Mountain's functional assessment will be donated through Nextera's corporate electronics recycling partnership with a local Bay Area nonprofit that provides refurbished computers to underserved schools and community organizations. Units that fail functional assessment are recycled through Iron Mountain's R2-certified e-waste recycling stream.

Subject: RE: IT Asset Lifecycle — Q3 Hardware Refresh Plan

Diana, James,

Quick logistics update from Facilities:

    1. Staging Area: I've reserved the large staging area on Floor 6 (the decommissioned server room from last year's infrastructure migration) for the hardware refresh. The room has workbench space, power strips, and ethernet connections for approximately 30 units simultaneously. Wave 1 (41 units) will need to run in two batches through staging.

    2. Delivery: CDW ships on pallets for orders exceeding 20 units. I'll schedule a loading dock reservation at the building for the delivery date. We need 48 hours advance notice for dock reservations, so once CDW confirms a ship date, please loop me in immediately.

    3. Iron Mountain Pickup: I contacted our Iron Mountain rep. They can accommodate a single batch pickup of all 67 sanitized units at the end of Wave 3 in December. This avoids the $150 per-pickup fee that would apply if we scheduled separate pickups for each wave ($450 total versus $150 for one batch). Between waves, sanitized units will be stored in the secure storage cage on Floor 2 (badge-access restricted, camera monitored).

Rachel,

The single batch pickup is the right call — simpler logistics and $300 in savings. I'll update the disposition plan to reflect on-site secure storage between waves with the December batch pickup.

Here are the consolidated next steps:

    Diana: Request updated CDW quote (M4 Pro/36GB for Engineering) — by September 30
    Diana: Circulate complete project plan (quote, rollout calendar, IT support assignments) — by October 1
    Procurement: Submit PO to CDW — by October 3 pending approval
    CDW: Expected delivery — week of October 6 (3-5 business day lead time from PO)
    Rachel: Reserve Floor 6 staging area, schedule loading dock, confirm Iron Mountain December pickup
    James: Communicate refresh timeline to Engineering team leads, identify any scheduling conflicts with Sprint 22

If there are no objections by October 3, I'll consider the plan approved and we'll proceed with the PO submission.

Thank you both for the quick turnaround.
