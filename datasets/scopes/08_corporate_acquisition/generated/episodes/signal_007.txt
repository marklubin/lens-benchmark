MEMORANDUM

TO:      Rachel Dominguez, General Counsel
FROM:    Nathan Foley, Senior Corporate Counsel
DATE:    January 24, 2025
RE:      Review of Change-of-Control Provisions in Executive Employment Agreements

I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Per your request, I have completed the review of change-of-control provisions across all 14 executive employment agreements. This memorandum summarizes the current state of the provisions, identifies areas where our agreements deviate from current market practice, and proposes revisions to align with benchmarking data from the Compensia 2024 Executive Compensation Survey. The proposed revisions differentiate between C-suite and VP-level executives, reflecting the market trend toward tiered acceleration structures.

II. SCOPE OF REVIEW

I reviewed executive employment agreements for the following individuals:

C-Suite Executives (5):
1. David Aldric, Chief Executive Officer — agreement effective March 15, 2019 (date of hire), last amended October 2023
2. Priya Vasquez, Chief Financial Officer — agreement effective June 1, 2020, last amended October 2023
3. Marcus Webb, Chief Technology Officer — agreement effective January 10, 2020, last amended October 2023
4. Rachel Dominguez, General Counsel — agreement effective September 1, 2021, last amended October 2023
5. Vanessa Kline, Vice President of People — agreement effective February 15, 2021, last amended October 2023

VP-Level Executives (9):
6. Hannah Choi, Vice President of Product — agreement effective April 1, 2022
7. Kevin Orosco, Vice President of Sales — agreement effective July 15, 2021
8. Amanda Briggs, Vice President of Customer Success — agreement effective November 1, 2021
9. Jordan Michaels, Vice President of Finance — agreement effective March 1, 2022
10. Frank Gutierrez, Chief Information Security Officer — agreement effective August 1, 2022
11. Lisa Chen, Director of Platform (VP-equivalent per agreement terms) — agreement effective May 15, 2020
12. Sami Okoro, Engineering Manager (VP-equivalent per agreement terms) — agreement effective January 3, 2022
13. Derek Hollis, FP&A Manager (VP-equivalent per recent promotion agreement) — agreement effective September 1, 2023
14. Angela Torres, Controller (VP-equivalent per agreement terms) — agreement effective March 15, 2021

Executive agreements reviewed: 14 total (5 C-suite, 9 VP-level).

III. CURRENT PROVISIONS

Current provisions: all executives receive double-trigger acceleration (termination + change of control). I recommend aligning with current market practice. The current change-of-control provisions are identical across all 14 agreements and contain the following terms:

A. Change of Control Definition

The current change-of-control definition in all 14 agreements is as follows: acquisition of 50% or more of voting shares or substantially all assets of the company by a person or group. The definition also includes certain board composition changes (a majority of the board being replaced within any 12-month period by directors whose appointment was not endorsed by a majority of the existing board).

The current definition does not address mergers where the company's stockholders retain less than 50% of the surviving entity, which is a common market provision. I recommend adding this to the revised definition. Additionally, the current definition does not address tender offers or reverse mergers, which are increasingly common transaction structures in the enterprise software sector. For completeness, I recommend including these in the revised definition as well.

I also note that the current definition does not include a carve-out for internal restructurings or reorganizations that do not involve a third-party acquirer. This is standard market practice and should be added to prevent inadvertent triggering of acceleration provisions in connection with routine corporate transactions such as holding company formations or divisional restructurings.

B. Acceleration Trigger

All 14 agreements currently contain a double-trigger acceleration mechanism: 100% of unvested equity accelerates only upon both (i) a change of control and (ii) the executive's involuntary termination without cause or resignation for good reason within 12 months following the change of control.

The "cause" definition in the current agreements includes: material breach of the agreement, conviction of a felony, willful misconduct causing material harm to the company, or failure to perform duties after written notice and 30-day cure period. The "good reason" definition includes: material reduction in base salary (more than 10%), material reduction in authority or responsibilities, relocation of more than 50 miles, or material breach of the agreement by the company.

C. Severance Terms

All 14 agreements currently provide 12 months of base salary as severance upon a qualifying double-trigger event. There is no distinction between C-suite and VP-level severance under the current agreements. The severance is paid in a lump sum within 30 days of the qualifying termination, subject to the executive's execution of a general release of claims. The agreements also provide for 12 months of continued COBRA benefits at the company's expense.

D. Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation

All 14 agreements contain 12-month post-termination non-competition and 18-month non-solicitation covenants. These covenants apply regardless of the circumstances of termination. I note that the enforceability of non-competition provisions varies by jurisdiction and that California, where 12 of 14 executives are based, generally does not enforce post-employment non-competition covenants under Business and Professions Code Section 16600. The non-solicitation provisions are generally enforceable in California, however.

E. Estimated Values

At the current 409A valuation of $14.20 per share, the estimated equity value subject to acceleration across all 14 executives is approximately $42 million. This figure breaks down as follows:

- CEO (Aldric): $12.4M in unvested equity (874,648 unvested shares)
- CFO (Vasquez): $6.8M in unvested equity (478,873 unvested shares)
- CTO (Webb): $5.2M in unvested equity (366,197 unvested shares)
- GC (Dominguez): $4.1M in unvested equity (288,732 unvested shares)
- VP People (Kline): $3.5M in unvested equity (246,479 unvested shares)
- VP-level executives (9 total): $10.0M in unvested equity aggregate (704,225 unvested shares)

Total shares subject to acceleration: 2,959,154

IV. MARKET BENCHMARKING

I reviewed the Compensia 2024 Executive Compensation Survey, which covers compensation practices at 287 technology companies with revenues between $50 million and $500 million. The survey, published in September 2024, is the most current source of market benchmarking data available for companies at our revenue stage. The survey reports the following market practices for change-of-control provisions:

Single-Trigger Acceleration (C-Suite):
- 68% of surveyed companies provide single-trigger acceleration for CEO
- 54% provide single-trigger acceleration for other C-suite executives
- Median acceleration: 100% of unvested equity
- Trend: The percentage of companies offering single-trigger acceleration to C-suite has increased from 58% in the 2022 survey to 68% in 2024, reflecting a clear market shift

Double-Trigger Acceleration (VP-Level):
- 82% of surveyed companies use double-trigger acceleration for VP-level executives
- Most common employment requirement: 12 months post-closing
- Median acceleration: 100% of unvested equity upon qualifying termination
- Only 11% of companies provide single-trigger acceleration at the VP level

Severance Multiples:
- CEO median: 24 months base salary + target bonus
- Other C-suite median: 18 months base salary + target bonus
- VP-level median: 12 months base salary (no bonus multiplier)
- 73% of companies provide COBRA continuation for the severance period

Change of Control Definition:
- 91% include acquisition of 50%+ voting shares
- 87% include sale of substantially all assets
- 79% include mergers resulting in stockholder dilution below 50%
- 62% include board composition changes

V. PROPOSED REVISIONS

Based on the benchmarking analysis, I propose the following revisions to align with current market standards:

A. C-Suite Executives (CEO, CFO, CTO, GC, VP People)

Proposed revision for C-Suite (CEO, CFO, CTO, GC, VP People): single-trigger acceleration of 100% of unvested equity upon a qualifying change-of-control event. This means that upon a change of control, all unvested equity would accelerate immediately without any requirement for termination. This change aligns with the majority practice (54-68%) reported in the Compensia survey.

Proposed severance for C-suite: 24 months base salary + target bonus. This is an increase from the current 12 months base salary and aligns with the median practice reported in the Compensia survey. The aggregate severance exposure for the 5 C-suite executives, based on current compensation, is approximately $5.8 million (salary component only) plus approximately $2.9 million in target bonus, for a total of approximately $8.7 million.

COBRA continuation: extended from 12 months to 24 months for C-suite executives, consistent with the severance period.

B. VP-Level Executives

VP-level executives: double-trigger acceleration with a 12-month post-closing continued employment requirement. This aligns with the 2024 Compensia survey data. Under this provision, VP-level executives would receive 100% acceleration of unvested equity only if they are terminated without cause or resign for good reason within 12 months following the change of control.

Proposed severance for VP-level: 12 months base salary. This maintains the current severance level for VP-level executives, which is at the market median. No change to the COBRA continuation period for VP-level executives.

C. Updated Change of Control Definition

I recommend expanding the change-of-control definition to include:
- Acquisition of 50% or more of voting shares
- Sale of substantially all assets
- Merger or consolidation where existing stockholders hold less than 50% of surviving entity
- Board composition change (majority replacement within 12 months)
- Tender offer resulting in acquirer holding more than 50% of outstanding shares
- Carve-out: excludes internal restructurings, recapitalizations, and IPO transactions

This expanded definition is consistent with market practice and provides clearer coverage for a broader range of transaction structures.

VI. IMPLEMENTATION

I recommend the following implementation approach:

1. Present the proposed revisions to the Compensation Committee for review — targeting February 2025
2. Obtain Board approval at the next regular Board meeting — targeting February 2025
3. Prepare amended employment agreements for execution — within 30 days of Board approval
4. Coordinate with VP People on communication to affected executives — concurrent with agreement execution
5. File updated equity plan provisions with the SEC as required — within 10 business days of amendment

The estimated timeline is:
- Compensation Committee review: first week of February 2025
- Board approval: February 2025 Board meeting (tentatively February 10)
- Agreement execution: within 30 days of Board approval
- Employee notification: concurrent with agreement execution

I recommend Board approval at the next regular meeting. The documentation required for Board review includes: (1) this memorandum, (2) redlined versions of each executive agreement showing proposed changes, (3) a summary of the Compensia benchmarking data, and (4) a financial impact analysis prepared by the CFO's office.

VII. TAX CONSIDERATIONS

I have consulted with our outside tax counsel at Morrison & Partners regarding the Section 280G implications of the proposed changes. The single-trigger acceleration for C-suite executives could result in parachute payments that exceed the safe harbor threshold under Section 280G. The safe harbor threshold is three times the executive's "base amount" (defined as the average W-2 compensation over the preceding five years).

I recommend that the revised agreements include a best-of-net provision, which would reduce payments to the safe harbor amount only if the executive would receive a greater after-tax benefit. This approach avoids the need for stockholder approval under Section 280G(b)(5)(B) and is the most common approach among our peer group (used by 64% of companies in the Compensia survey).

The estimated Section 280G exposure based on current compensation levels and equity values is approximately $8.2 million across all C-suite executives. This figure would change based on the actual transaction price in any future change-of-control event. Morrison & Partners has provided detailed calculations for each C-suite executive, which are available upon request.

I also note that the Section 409A implications of the proposed changes need to be reviewed. The acceleration of vesting upon a change of control is generally not treated as a modification of the equity award for 409A purposes if the acceleration is provided under the equity plan rather than as an individual arrangement. Morrison & Partners is reviewing this issue and will provide a supplemental opinion by January 31.

VIII. PEER COMPANY COMPARISON

For additional context, I compiled change-of-control provisions from publicly available information at five peer companies in the enterprise software space with comparable revenue and employee count:

1. Veeva Systems (FY2024 revenue: $2.4B) — Single-trigger for CEO, double-trigger for all others, 18-month post-closing period
2. Datadog (FY2024 revenue: $2.1B) — Single-trigger for C-suite, double-trigger for VP+, 12-month post-closing period
3. Confluent (FY2024 revenue: $780M) — Single-trigger for CEO and CFO only, double-trigger for all others
4. Braze (FY2024 revenue: $470M) — Double-trigger for all executives, 12-month post-closing period
5. nCino (FY2024 revenue: $480M) — Single-trigger for C-suite, double-trigger for VP+, 12-month post-closing period

Our proposed structure (single-trigger for C-suite, double-trigger for VP-level) is consistent with the most common approach among our peers.

IX. CONCLUSION

The proposed revisions bring our executive agreements in line with current market practice as reported in the Compensia 2024 survey. The key changes are: (1) moving from double-trigger to single-trigger acceleration for C-suite executives, (2) raising C-suite severance to 24 months base salary plus target bonus, (3) standardizing the change-of-control definition, and (4) maintaining double-trigger acceleration with 12-month employment requirement for VP-level executives. These changes would apply to all 14 executive agreements.

I am available to discuss these recommendations at your convenience and can prepare the draft amended agreements upon your approval. I anticipate the drafting process will take approximately one week once direction is given.

Nathan Foley

@channel Axion eval week 2 update. Posting here for visibility.

Axion eval week 2: load testing is solid. 10K req/min, sub-200ms p99. Their data coverage is 55% broader than our current provider.

Numbers in detail:
- Sustained load test: 10,000 requests per minute for 30 minutes
- p99 latency under load: 195ms
- p50 latency under load: 42ms
- Error rate: 0.002% (2 errors in 300,000 requests)
- Data coverage: 340 shipping lanes (Axion) vs 220 lanes (our current provider, DataTrack)

For comparison, here's what DataTrack gives us:
- Sustained load: 6,000 requests per minute (above that, we start seeing timeouts)
- p99 latency under load: 380ms
- p50 latency under load: 95ms
- Error rate at 6K req/min: 0.01%
- Data coverage: 220 shipping lanes

So on every metric, Axion is meaningfully better. The coverage gap is the most compelling part — 120 additional lanes, and they're disproportionately in the regions where our customers are asking for better data.

[10:17 AM] ben.arujo
those numbers are impressive. especially the data coverage gap. 120 additional lanes is a lot of ground to make up if we stick with DataTrack. and the latency difference is not trivial either — 195ms vs 380ms at p99 is nearly 2x improvement.

[10:18 AM] hannah.choi
agreed. and the lanes they cover are disproportionately in APAC and South America, which are exactly where our customers have been asking for better data. The customer interview results back this up — I'll have Ben share those in a minute.

[10:20 AM] sofia.martinez.design
what's the UX plan for the integration? are we redesigning the data views or layering Axion data into existing views?

[10:22 AM] hannah.choi
good question. Initial plan is to layer it in — the Axion API response format is close enough to our internal data model that we can map it without a major UI overhaul. Phase 1 is data availability, Phase 2 is optimized UX. I think we can get Phase 1 done in the estimated 6-8 engineering weeks that Raj scoped out, and Phase 2 would be a separate project in Q2. The goal is to get customer value as quickly as possible without overengineering the initial integration.

[10:24 AM] ben.arujo
Customer feedback from 6 interviews: 5 of 6 said real-time logistics data is a top-3 priority. The Axion integration could be a major differentiator.

Here's the breakdown by customer:
1. FreightCo International — ranked real-time data #1 priority, specifically cited APAC coverage gaps as their biggest pain point. They ship 40% of volume through APAC lanes that DataTrack doesn't cover well.
2. Pacific Route Inc — ranked it #2 behind cost optimization. Their head of logistics said "we make routing decisions with 12-hour-old data, and in APAC that means we're often surprised by port delays."
3. MegaPort Solutions — ranked it #1 priority. They are evaluating us specifically because of the promise of real-time data integration. If we don't deliver, they said they'd look at SupplyVision AI as an alternative.
4. NordicFreight — ranked it #3. They're primarily interested in European lane coverage, which Axion also improves (32 new European lanes vs DataTrack).
5. TransPacific Shipping — ranked it #1 priority. Their entire business is APAC routes. They called Axion-level coverage "table stakes" for their next vendor evaluation.
6. Continental Carriers — ranked it at #5, but they also have the least APAC exposure. Their focus is North American domestic freight, where DataTrack coverage is adequate.

We have 4 more interviews scheduled for next week to hit our target of 10. I'm prioritizing customers with high APAC and South American exposure for the remaining slots.

[10:27 AM] hannah.choi
great data @ben.arujo. exactly what we need to build the business case. the pattern of APAC-heavy customers prioritizing this is noteworthy. it also aligns with Kevin's sales pipeline — several of the large enterprise opportunities in Q1 are APAC-focused logistics companies.

[10:29 AM] derek.chang.pm
have we looked at Axion's API docs for webhooks? our customers have been asking for push notifications when lane conditions change. if Axion supports event streaming, that's a huge plus. I've had three customer requests for real-time alerts in the last two months alone.

[10:31 AM] ben.arujo
they support webhooks and a streaming API. I tested the webhook latency yesterday — events are delivered within 2.5 seconds of condition change. the streaming API uses Server-Sent Events, which is a bit simpler than our WebSocket architecture but still very workable. I ran a 24-hour endurance test on the SSE connection and it was stable with automatic reconnection on the one disconnect I saw (their side, graceful reconnect in under 500ms).

here are the event types they support:
- lane_delay: triggered when a lane's estimated transit time exceeds historical average by >15%
- port_congestion: triggered when port vessel queue exceeds capacity threshold
- weather_disruption: triggered on severe weather events affecting active lanes
- rate_change: triggered when spot rates change by >5% within a 4-hour window
- customs_alert: triggered on customs processing delays exceeding 24 hours

each event includes: lane_id, event_type, severity (1-5), affected_origin, affected_destination, estimated_duration, confidence_score, and a raw_data payload with the underlying metrics.

[10:33 AM] derek.chang.pm
2.5s webhook latency is great. most of our alerts don't need sub-second delivery. and the event taxonomy is well-designed — those five event types map cleanly to the alert categories our customers have been requesting. the confidence_score field is a nice touch too.

[10:35 AM] hannah.choi
I'm planning to visit their Austin office first week of February to discuss partnership terms. @ben.arujo you should come too.

Visit tentatively scheduled Feb 3-4. Agenda would be:
- Technical deep-dive with their engineering team (2 hours)
- Data coverage roadmap review — I want to understand their expansion plans for 2025-2026 (1 hour)
- Partnership commercial terms discussion (1.5 hours)
- Meet their leadership team — CEO Sarah Woodward, CTO James Liu (1 hour)
- Office tour and working session (1 hour)

[10:37 AM] ben.arujo
definitely in. I'll clear my calendar for those days. should we bring an engineer too? it would be good to have someone from Lisa's platform team evaluate their infrastructure firsthand. they claim 99.97% uptime but I'd like to understand their architecture.

[10:39 AM] hannah.choi
good idea. let me check with Marcus on who's available. we don't want to pull anyone off K8s migration prep though. Lisa's team is going to be heads-down on the production migration that same week, so it might need to be someone from Raj's team instead.

[10:42 AM] sofia.martinez.design
can I join the Austin trip? I'd like to see their data visualization tools and understand what we might want to adopt vs build ourselves. their demo dashboard had a really clean map component that I've been thinking about.

[10:43 AM] hannah.choi
sure, Sofia. I'll add you to the travel request. party of 3, maybe 4 if we get an engineer. I'll book the travel today — Southwest has direct flights from SFO to Austin Bergstrom that work with our schedule.

[10:45 AM] ben.arujo
one more data point — estimated partnership deal value based on their published pricing tiers: $180K-$250K per year depending on data volume and API call limits. that's actually competitive with what we're paying DataTrack ($195K/year) for significantly less coverage.

Pricing tier breakdown (from their enterprise pricing page):
- Growth tier: $120K/year — 200 lanes, 5K req/min, webhooks included
- Enterprise tier: $180K/year — 340 lanes, 10K req/min, streaming + webhooks, dedicated support
- Enterprise Plus tier: $250K/year — 340+ lanes (custom), 25K req/min, streaming + webhooks, dedicated support, SLA guarantees, custom event types

We'd probably land in Enterprise or Enterprise Plus depending on negotiated terms.

[10:47 AM] hannah.choi
right, so it's potentially cost-neutral or only marginally more expensive for 55% more coverage. I'll build that into the business case. the ROI story writes itself: same cost, dramatically better data, and it unlocks the APAC growth opportunity that Kevin's team is chasing.

[10:50 AM] derek.chang.pm
switching topics — where are we on the rec engine v3 product requirements? I need to finalize the launch blog post and I want to make sure I'm covering the right features. Marcus's team said GA is tracking for Feb 14.

[10:52 AM] hannah.choi
feature list is final and locked. I'll send you the PRD link. Key features for the blog: improved relevance scoring (30% better in A/B testing), sub-300ms latency at scale, and the new explainability module that shows users why specific routes were recommended. those are the three pillars of the v3 messaging.

full feature list:
1. Improved relevance scoring algorithm (30% improvement in A/B testing vs v2)
2. Sub-300ms latency at production scale (2M+ records)
3. Explainability module — "Why this route?" explanations for each recommendation
4. Sparse matrix handling — graceful degradation when data is incomplete
5. Multi-modal data fusion — combines historical, real-time, and predictive data sources
6. Batch recommendation API for offline processing
7. Confidence scoring per recommendation (0-100 scale)
8. Custom weighting API — customers can adjust optimization parameters

[10:54 AM] derek.chang.pm
the explainability module is going to be great marketing material. customers have been asking for that for two quarters now. the "Why this route?" angle is perfect for the blog.

[10:56 AM] ben.arujo
agreed. NordicFreight literally said in their interview last week that recommendation transparency is the number one thing they want in 2025. and three other customers mentioned it unprompted in QBR feedback. the timing of v3 launch is really good.

[10:58 AM] hannah.choi
@derek.chang.pm I'll send you the PRD and the A/B testing results by end of day. the blog should focus on the three pillars — relevance, speed, and explainability — and include at least one customer quote if we can get clearance. I'll check with Amanda's team on which customers might be willing to be quoted.

[11:00 AM] hannah.choi
alright, good sync everyone. I'll post the Austin trip logistics in the #product-travel channel. any other Axion eval questions can go there too. next update will be after the Austin visit.

[11:02 AM] sofia.martinez.design
one thing — the Axion dashboard we saw in the demo has a really clean map component. can we get a recording of their demo to reference during our design work? I've been sketching some ideas for how we could integrate their geographic visualization with our existing dashboard.

[11:03 AM] ben.arujo
I recorded the demo last Tuesday. I'll share the link in #product-design. it's about 45 minutes — the map component section starts around the 22 minute mark.

[11:04 AM] sofia.martinez.design
:pray: thank you

[11:06 AM] derek.chang.pm
quick question — are we still planning to sunset DataTrack if the Axion partnership goes through, or would we run both providers in parallel? the redundancy could be valuable for reliability.

[11:08 AM] hannah.choi
TBD. my initial thinking is a transition period of 3-6 months where we run both, then evaluate whether we need DataTrack as a fallback. if Axion's uptime holds at 99.97% in production, I don't think we need the redundancy. but that's a decision we'd make after we see real production data, not before.

[11:10 AM] ben.arujo
I'd advocate for keeping DataTrack as a fallback for at least 6 months. switching data providers is risky and if Axion has an outage during a peak shipping season, we'd want the fallback. the $195K/year for DataTrack is cheap insurance.

[11:12 AM] hannah.choi
fair point. we can build that into the business case as a "transition cost" line item. let's revisit after 6 months of production data.

[11:15 AM] derek.chang.pm
unrelated question — has anyone heard anything about the company meeting schedule changing? I saw David's calendar has some odd entries this week and I wasn't sure if something big is coming up. he had something labeled just "ML" on Thursday evening which seemed odd.

[11:17 AM] hannah.choi
no changes to the meeting schedule that I know of. David has the standard all-hands on Monday. nothing out of the ordinary from what I can see. probably just a personal dinner or something.

[11:18 AM] derek.chang.pm
cool, probably nothing. just wondering.

[11:25 AM] ben.arujo
back to Axion — their documentation is really good, which is a nice change from some of the APIs we've integrated with. the developer portal has interactive API explorers, code samples in Python and Go, and a sandbox environment with realistic test data. makes our evaluation much smoother.

I spent about 2 hours yesterday going through their documentation and here are my notes:
- Authentication: OAuth 2.0 with API keys as fallback, standard scopes
- Rate limiting: clearly documented, per-endpoint limits, graceful 429 responses with retry-after headers
- Versioning: URL-based versioning (v2 is current), v1 deprecated but still supported through June 2025
- SDKs: Python (official, pip installable), Go (official), JavaScript (community maintained)
- Sandbox: separate environment with synthetic but realistic data, no rate limits, free tier access
- Changelog: detailed, weekly updates, breaking changes flagged 90 days in advance
- Status page: public status page with historical uptime data (99.97% trailing 12 months)

[11:27 AM] hannah.choi
yeah, their developer experience team is a highlight. That's something we should aspire to for our own APIs, honestly. maybe we can learn from their approach when we revamp our developer portal in Q2.

[11:30 AM] sofia.martinez.design
end of thread. thanks for the Axion update @hannah.choi. exciting stuff. looking forward to the Austin trip.

Subject: RE: Equity Acceleration Policy — Proposed Updates
Date: January 24, 2025
From: Vanessa Kline (VP People)
To: David Aldric (CEO), Rachel Dominguez (GC)
Classification: Confidential — Executive

--- Original Message ---
From: Vanessa Kline <v.kline@nexterasolutions.com>

Subject: Equity Acceleration Policy — Proposed Updates

David, Rachel,

Per our discussion, I've drafted updates to the equity acceleration policy. The key change is adding a 'qualifying event' definition that would trigger acceleration for eligible employees.

I've been working on this since our conversation last week and have incorporated the feedback from our preliminary review. Here's a summary of the proposed changes and the rationale:

1. QUALIFYING EVENT DEFINITION

We're proposing to add a "qualifying event" definition to the Nextera Equity Plan. Currently, the equity plan does not contain a standalone definition of qualifying events that trigger acceleration. The acceleration provisions are embedded in individual employment agreements, which creates inconsistency across the employee population.

The proposed qualifying event definition includes:
- Change of control (acquisition of 50% or more of voting shares or substantially all assets)
- Initial public offering
- Specified asset sale exceeding $50 million

This definition would be incorporated into the equity plan itself, creating a single source of truth for all participants. Currently, 380 of our 406 employees hold equity under the plan, so this change affects the vast majority of our workforce.

I've reviewed the definitions used by comparable companies in the Compensia survey and our proposed language is consistent with the most common formulations. I've also ensured alignment with the language Nathan Foley is using in the executive agreement revisions.

2. ACCELERATION TIERS

The proposed policy creates three tiers of acceleration upon a qualifying event:

Tier 1 (C-Suite): Single-trigger acceleration of 100% of unvested equity
  - Applies to: CEO, CFO, CTO, GC, VP People (5 individuals)
  - Trigger: qualifying event alone, no termination required
  - Rationale: aligns with 68% of peer companies for CEO, 54% for other C-suite

Tier 2 (VP-Level): Double-trigger acceleration of 100% of unvested equity, requiring termination within 12 months post-closing
  - Applies to: 9 VP-level executives
  - Trigger: qualifying event + involuntary termination without cause or resignation for good reason
  - Rationale: aligns with 82% of peer companies at VP level

Tier 3 (All Other Employees): Double-trigger acceleration of 50% of unvested equity, requiring termination within 12 months post-closing
  - Applies to: 366 employees holding equity
  - Trigger: qualifying event + involuntary termination without cause
  - Rationale: new benefit not previously available; 50% acceleration is at the upper end of market practice for non-executive employees

This tiered approach is consistent with the recommendations in Nathan Foley's legal memo, which I understand he submitted to Rachel today.

3. FINANCIAL IMPACT

Total unvested equity pool: $68 million at the current 409A valuation of $14.20 per share.

Breakdown by tier:
- Tier 1 (C-Suite, 5 individuals): $32.0M in unvested equity
- Tier 2 (VP-Level, 9 individuals): $10.0M in unvested equity
- Tier 3 (All other employees, 366 individuals): $26.0M in unvested equity

The maximum acceleration exposure under the proposed policy (assuming all triggers are met for all tiers) is the full $68 million. In practice, Tier 2 and Tier 3 would only accelerate upon qualifying terminations. Based on industry data, approximately 30-40% of employees experience qualifying terminations within 12 months of a change of control, so the expected exposure is more likely in the range of $40-50 million.

For budgeting and board presentation purposes, I've prepared three scenarios:
- Conservative (Tier 1 only triggers): $32.0M
- Base case (Tier 1 + 35% of Tier 2/3): $44.6M
- Full exposure (all tiers, all triggers): $68.0M

I've also noted that the 409A valuation of $14.20 per share was set in October 2024 and is scheduled for an update in April 2025. Any qualifying event would likely result in a transaction price significantly above the 409A valuation, so the actual dollar exposure would exceed these estimates.

4. COMMUNICATION PLAN

I'm planning to communicate the updated policy as follows:
- Board approval: target the February Board meeting
- Company-wide announcement: within one week of Board approval, via all-hands presentation
- Employee information session: scheduled for February 10 (tentative), in-person + Zoom
- FAQ document: posted to HR intranet concurrent with announcement
- Individual equity statement updates: distributed within 30 days of effective date
- Manager toolkit: talking points and Q&A guide distributed to all managers 48 hours before company announcement

I'd like both of your input on the communication approach. The key message I want to convey is that this is a routine update to align with market best practices, not a response to any specific event. We want employees to see this as a positive enhancement to their compensation package.

5. RETENTION ANALYSIS

I've also analyzed the retention implications of the proposed changes. With 380 equity holders, the acceleration provisions are a meaningful retention tool. Here's the analysis:

Average unvested equity value by level:
- C-Suite: $6.4M per executive
- VP-Level: $1.1M per executive
- Senior IC/Manager: $142K per employee
- Mid-level: $68K per employee
- Junior: $22K per employee

The Tier 3 acceleration provision (50% acceleration on qualifying termination) represents a new benefit worth approximately $11K-$71K per employee depending on level. For senior ICs and managers, this is a material benefit that strengthens retention.

Our current voluntary turnover rate is 8.2% (trailing 12 months). Among employees in the top quartile of unvested equity value, voluntary turnover is 3.1%. The acceleration provision reinforces the retention value of unvested equity by providing protection against involuntary loss of equity in a change-of-control scenario.

6. TIMELINE

- January 24: Submit to legal for review (today)
- January 31: Receive legal redlines
- February Board meeting: Board approval
- March 1: Effective date

Please let me know if you have questions or want to discuss further.

Subject: RE: Equity Acceleration Policy — Proposed Updates

Vanessa,

This looks comprehensive. A few thoughts:

1. Good. Please coordinate with Nathan Foley — he's updating the exec agreements in parallel. We need these to be consistent. I don't want any gaps between the equity plan provisions and the individual employment agreements. If there's a conflict, the more favorable provision should control. Have Nathan do a side-by-side review of the definitions to confirm alignment.

2. The three-tier structure makes sense. I want to make sure Tier 3 employees understand that this is an improvement over the current plan, where there's no acceleration provision for non-executive employees at all. That's a strong retention message. Frame it as: "We believe all employees should share in the value they help create."

3. On communication: I agree that we should frame this as a market alignment update. I'd suggest having Vanessa present it at the all-hands rather than sending it as an email. It deserves a live explanation where people can ask questions. The February 10 information session timing works if we can get Board approval at the January meeting. If we're targeting the February board meeting instead, adjust the session accordingly.

4. On timing: Is it possible to get Board approval at the January 21 meeting rather than waiting for February? I want to move quickly on this. The equity plan update is straightforward and the board should be supportive. I'd rather not wait an extra month.

5. The retention analysis is excellent. Please include that in the board presentation. The voluntary turnover data by equity quartile is compelling and will help the board understand the strategic rationale beyond just market alignment.

Let me know how you and Rachel want to proceed.

David

Subject: RE: RE: Equity Acceleration Policy — Proposed Updates

David, Vanessa,

Legal review is underway. I expect to have redlines back by January 31. We should target the February board meeting for approval.

A few notes from the legal perspective:

1. Coordination with Nathan's memo: I've already reviewed Nathan's proposed changes to the executive agreements and they are consistent with Vanessa's equity plan updates. We'll do a side-by-side comparison to ensure there are no gaps. The definitions of "qualifying event" and "change of control" need to match exactly between the two documents. I've asked Nathan to use identical language and he's confirmed he will.

2. Board approval: David, on your question about the January 21 meeting — that meeting has already occurred, so we'd need to schedule a special session or wait for the February regular meeting. Given the complexity of the equity plan amendment, I'd recommend waiting for February to ensure we have clean documents for the Board to review. I don't see a pressing reason to accelerate the timeline. Rushing legal documentation creates risk of errors that would require subsequent amendments.

3. Section 409A: The equity plan amendments need to be reviewed for 409A compliance. Nathan is coordinating with Morrison & Partners on this. We need to ensure that the acceleration provisions don't create a 409A violation for deferred compensation. This is standard but time-consuming to verify across 380 equity holders. Morrison & Partners has estimated one week for their review.

4. Communication: I agree with presenting at the all-hands. I'd also recommend that the FAQ document be reviewed by legal before publication. We need to be careful about the language used to describe qualifying events — we don't want to create expectations or anxiety among employees about any specific event. The messaging should be factual and forward-looking: "We are updating our equity plan to reflect current market practices."

5. Tax implications: The proposed policy may have Section 280G implications for C-suite executives in a change-of-control scenario. Nathan's memo addresses this, and I'm comfortable with the best-of-net approach he's recommending. We should disclose the potential 280G implications to the Board when presenting for approval. The estimated exposure of $8.2M should be presented alongside the best-of-net mitigation strategy.

6. Delaware law considerations: As a Delaware corporation, the equity plan amendment requires Board approval but not stockholder approval, provided the amendment is within the scope of the plan's existing amendment authority. I've confirmed that Section 15 of the current equity plan grants the Board broad amendment authority, including the authority to add acceleration provisions. No stockholder vote is needed.

I'll have redlines to Vanessa by January 31 as committed. If either of you want to discuss before then, I'm available. I'll also schedule a 30-minute call with Nathan and Morrison & Partners for Monday to ensure we're all aligned on the 409A analysis.

Subject: RE: RE: RE: Equity Acceleration Policy — Proposed Updates

David, Rachel,

Thank you both for the quick turnaround on feedback. Here's my action plan:

1. I'll coordinate with Nathan on Monday to align the equity plan language with the executive agreement revisions. Side-by-side comparison will be done by January 28. I'll use the "qualifying event" definition from the equity plan as the master and have Nathan conform the executive agreements to match.

2. Rachel — looking forward to your redlines by January 31. I'll incorporate them into a final draft for Board review. I'll plan to have the board-ready version completed by February 5 at the latest.

3. On the communication strategy: I'll prepare talking points for the all-hands presentation and draft the FAQ document. Rachel, I'll send you the FAQ for legal review by February 3. The FAQ will cover the following topics:
   - What is a qualifying event?
   - What does acceleration mean for my equity?
   - Which tier am I in?
   - How do I find out my unvested equity value?
   - When does this take effect?
   - Does this change my vesting schedule?
   - What happens if I leave the company voluntarily?

4. For the Tier 3 messaging, I'm thinking we highlight the following:
   - This is a new benefit — previously, non-executive employees had no acceleration provisions
   - 50% acceleration on qualifying event + termination is above market median for non-executive employees (Compensia reports 25-50% as the range)
   - This demonstrates the company's commitment to sharing value creation with all employees

5. I've also been thinking about the retention implications. With 380 equity holders, the acceleration provisions are a meaningful retention tool, especially for our senior individual contributors and managers who have significant unvested equity. The average unvested equity value for a Tier 3 employee is approximately $71K at current 409A. The 50% acceleration provision represents approximately $35K in additional protection for the average Tier 3 participant.

6. David — to your point about Board timing, Rachel's right that the January meeting has passed. I'll target the February meeting. The effective date of March 1 still works with that timeline. I'll send you the board presentation deck for pre-review by February 5.

7. On the broader equity competitiveness analysis you requested: I'll prepare that using the Compensia survey data and our own internal benchmarking, including grant sizes by level, vesting schedules, refresh grant cadence, burn rate analysis, and overhang analysis. That deck will be ready for your review by February 5 as well.

Let me know if there's anything else you need from me before January 31.

Best,
Vanessa

Vanessa,

Good plan. Proceed as outlined. Let's keep this tight — clean documents, clear communication, and no speculation.

One additional item: please pull together an analysis of our equity plan competitiveness versus the market. I want to present at the February Board meeting not just the acceleration changes but a broader view of how our equity compensation stacks up. Include data on grant sizes, vesting schedules, and refresh grants. The Board has been asking about retention, and a comprehensive equity analysis would be valuable context.

Key data points I want to see:
- Grant sizes at each level vs market percentiles (25th, 50th, 75th)
- Vesting schedule comparison (we're at 4-year with 1-year cliff)
- Refresh grant cadence and size (we currently do annual refreshes at ~25% of initial grant)
- Burn rate analysis (our annual equity burn rate is approximately 3.8%)
- Total dilution from outstanding and available equity
- Comparison to 5-7 peer companies of similar size and stage

I want the Board to see the full picture, not just the acceleration changes in isolation. Our compensation philosophy should be presented as a coherent strategy.

David

David,

Will do. I'll prepare the broader equity competitiveness analysis using the Compensia survey data and our own internal benchmarking. I'll have a draft deck for your review by February 5.

For reference, here are the key data points I'll include:

1. Equity grant sizes by level vs. market (25th, 50th, 75th percentile)
   - We currently target the 60th percentile for new hire grants, which is slightly above median
   - Refresh grants target the 50th percentile

2. Vesting schedules (we're at 4-year with 1-year cliff, which is standard)
   - 89% of companies in the Compensia survey use 4-year vesting
   - 74% use a 1-year cliff, which is what we do
   - Monthly vesting after cliff (our approach) is used by 68% of companies

3. Refresh grant cadence and size (we currently do annual refreshes at ~25% of initial grant)
   - Market median for annual refresh is 20-25% of initial grant
   - We're at the upper end of market practice, which is good for retention
   - Some companies are moving to semi-annual refreshes, but that's still a minority practice

4. Burn rate analysis (our annual equity burn rate is approximately 3.8%, which is within the ISS guideline of 5%)
   - ISS benchmark for technology companies: 5.0% burn rate threshold
   - Our 3.8% gives us headroom for additional grants without exceeding guidelines
   - Peer median: 4.1%

5. Overhang analysis (total dilution from outstanding and available equity)
   - Current overhang: 18.2% (shares outstanding + available pool as % of fully diluted shares)
   - Peer median: 19.5%
   - We're slightly below peer median, which is favorable

6. Peer comparison (I'll include the same 5 peers Nathan used in his memo, plus 2 additional)

I'll also include a section on ESPP — our current 15% discount is at market and the participation rate is 44% of eligible employees. I'll benchmark that as well.

One more thought: should I include a retention risk analysis in the board presentation? I can model the impact of different equity scenarios on retention for our top performers. We have the data from our last engagement survey that correlates equity satisfaction with retention intent.

Best,
Vanessa
