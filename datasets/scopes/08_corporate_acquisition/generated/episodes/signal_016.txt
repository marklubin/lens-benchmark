Subject: Comprehensive Change-of-Control Summary — Draft Review

Rachel,

Draft comprehensive CoC summary attached. 377 agreements reviewed. Key findings below.

I've completed the comprehensive review of every existing agreement in the company's contract management system for change-of-control provisions. The review spanned four major categories: employment agreements, vendor contracts, customer agreements, and real estate leases. The project required approximately three weeks of concentrated effort, including pulling agreements from both our current CLM platform and the archived legacy files that predated the system migration in 2022. I'm confident we have captured every material provision.

Below is the detailed breakdown by category with observations on each.

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS

Of the 416 current employees, 14 executive-level employment agreements contain explicit change-of-control provisions. These 14 agreements follow the standard executive employment template that has been in use since the board approved the revised executive compensation framework in Q2 2021. Each agreement includes the following provisions triggered upon a qualifying change-of-control event:

(a) Accelerated vesting of all outstanding equity awards, including stock options and restricted stock units, with vesting occurring immediately prior to the closing of the change-of-control transaction;

(b) Severance multipliers ranging from 1.5x to 3x base salary depending on the executive's tier designation, payable in a lump sum within 30 days of termination following a change of control;

(c) COBRA continuation coverage for 18 to 24 months, depending on the executive's tier designation, with the company paying the full premium cost during the continuation period;

(d) A prorated annual bonus based on target bonus percentage and the number of days employed during the fiscal year in which the change of control occurs.

I've catalogued the specific trigger definitions for each of the 14 agreements. The definitions are substantially similar but not identical — the agreements executed in 2021 and 2022 use a broader definition that includes asset sales exceeding 50% of the company's total assets, while the agreements executed in 2023 and 2024 use a narrower definition that requires a change in majority ownership of voting shares. This discrepancy should be harmonized if the company enters into any transaction that could trigger the broader definition without triggering the narrower one.

The remaining 402 non-executive employee agreements do not contain individual change-of-control provisions. Those employees are covered under the company's general severance plan, which was recently restructured effective March 1, 2025, reducing non-executive severance from a 2x base salary multiplier to a 1x base salary multiplier. The general severance plan does not contain a change-of-control trigger — it applies only in cases of involuntary termination without cause.

A few notes on the employment category:

- Two of the 14 executive agreements (CFO Priya Vasquez and VP Engineering Marcus Webb) include additional "gross-up" provisions for excise taxes under Section 280G/4999 of the Internal Revenue Code. These were negotiated as part of their original offer packages and are not present in any other executive agreement.

- The General Counsel (Rachel Dominguez) agreement includes a specific provision requiring continuation of D&O insurance coverage for 6 years following a change of control, which is separate from the standard tail coverage in the company's D&O policy.

- VP People Vanessa Kline's agreement includes a provision requiring 90 days' advance notice of any contemplated reduction in force following a change of control, which is unique among the executive agreements.

VENDOR CONTRACTS

42 vendor contracts require notification within 30 days of a change-of-control event. 18 customer contracts require affirmative consent from the customer prior to assignment. 3 leases require landlord consent for assignment.

The vendor notification obligations are straightforward in the majority of cases. Most use boilerplate language requiring written notice within 30 calendar days of the effective date of any change-of-control event. The notification is informational only — none of these 42 contracts grant the vendor a termination right triggered solely by change of control. However, several contracts do include provisions that allow the vendor to renegotiate pricing or modify service terms following a change of control, which could have financial implications.

I've organized the vendor contracts by tier based on annual spend:

Tier 1 (annual spend exceeding $500,000 per year): 8 contracts
- Amazon Web Services — Enterprise Agreement ($4.2M annual, multi-year term expiring December 2026). CoC provision requires 30 days' written notice plus a certification that the successor entity will assume all obligations under the existing service terms. AWS retains the right to conduct a credit review of the successor entity and may require modified payment terms based on that review.
- Snowflake — Data Cloud Agreement ($1.8M annual, term expiring March 2026). Standard 30-day notification. Includes a most-favored-nation pricing clause that survives assignment.
- Salesforce — Enterprise License ($980K annual, 3-year term). Standard 30-day notification with automatic assignment to successor entity.
- Datadog — Monitoring Platform ($720K annual, annual renewal). Standard notification. Month-to-month cancellation provision unaffected by CoC.
- Cloudflare — Enterprise Security ($640K annual, 2-year term). Standard notification.
- Okta — Identity Management ($580K annual, 3-year term). Standard notification. Includes data processing addendum that requires separate counterparty acknowledgment.
- Confluent — Event Streaming Platform ($560K annual, annual). Standard notification.
- Elastic — Search and Observability ($510K annual, 2-year term). Standard notification.

Tier 2 (annual spend $100,000 to $500,000): 14 contracts across various SaaS and infrastructure providers including Twilio, SendGrid, PagerDuty, CircleCI, GitHub Enterprise, Jira/Atlassian, Figma, Notion, Zoom, Slack, and four others. All contain standard 30-day notification provisions without material variations.

Tier 3 (annual spend under $100,000): 20 contracts with primarily professional services firms, staffing agencies, and specialty consultants. All standard notification provisions.

Total annual vendor spend covered by CoC notification requirements: approximately $14.8M.

CUSTOMER CONTRACTS

18 customer contracts contain change-of-control consent requirements. These are enterprise customer agreements negotiated with counterparties who had sufficient leverage during the sales cycle to include assignment restrictions. Unlike the vendor notifications, these require affirmative written consent from the customer before any assignment or transfer of the agreement in connection with a change of control.

I've prepared a preliminary risk assessment for each of the 18 customer contracts, considering factors such as:
- Remaining contract term and renewal date
- Historical renewal rate and expansion history
- Current customer health score from the CS team's dashboard
- The customer's historical approach to consent requests in other vendor relationships
- Whether the customer has an active competitive evaluation underway
- The customer's internal procurement policies for consent approvals

The combined annual contract value of these 18 agreements is $8.4M. I'll have a more detailed financial breakdown in the highlighted list you've requested.

Key customer contracts requiring consent (top 5 by ACV):
1. GlobalShip Industries — $890K ACV, renewed January 2025, 3-year term, green health
2. DB Schenker — $420K ACV, expansion in Q1, 2-year term, green health
3. Maersk Digital — $380K ACV, stable, 2-year remaining, green health
4. Ceva Logistics — $310K ACV, stable, 18 months remaining, yellow health
5. TransGlobal Logistics — $180K ACV, recently evaluated competitors, red health

LEASE AGREEMENTS

3 office leases contain change-of-control assignment restrictions:

1. 14th Floor — Headquarters (Primary lease)
   - Landlord: Meridian Real Estate Holdings (no relation to Meridian Corp)
   - Lease area: 22,000 sq ft
   - Term: through December 2029
   - Monthly rent: $110,000 ($60/sq ft annual)
   - CoC provision: Requires landlord consent for assignment. Includes a recapture right allowing the landlord to terminate the lease and reclaim the space in lieu of consenting to assignment. Landlord has 30 days to exercise recapture right after receiving notice.

2. 13th Floor — Engineering Expansion (New lease)
   - Landlord: Meridian Real Estate Holdings
   - Lease area: 8,000 sq ft
   - Term: 18 months from March 1, 2025
   - Monthly rent: $48,000 ($72/sq ft annual, premium rate for short-term)
   - CoC provision: Requires landlord consent for assignment. No recapture right. Shorter term reduces landlord risk.

3. Warehouse Facility — Data Center Equipment
   - Landlord: Pacific Industrial Partners
   - Lease area: 3,200 sq ft
   - Term: through June 2026
   - Monthly rent: $8,800 ($33/sq ft annual)
   - CoC provision: Standard consent requirement. Landlord may not unreasonably withhold consent.

SUMMARY TABLE

| Category | Total Reviewed | CoC Provision | Notification Only | Consent Required |
|----------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Employment | 416 | 14 | — | — |
| Vendor | 168 | 42 | 42 | 0 |

Nathan,

Good work. Please prepare a separate highlighted list of all contracts requiring counterparty consent — not just notification. I need this by February 28.

Specifically, I want the following for each contract:

1. Contract name and counterparty
2. Annual contract value
3. Consent provision language (quoted verbatim from the agreement)
4. Any termination rights triggered by failure to obtain consent
5. Current relationship status — coordinate with Amanda Briggs's team for customer health data
6. Estimated timeline to obtain consent based on the counterparty's known procurement processes
7. Any historical precedent for consent requests with the same counterparty

For the leases, include the landlord name, remaining term, any recapture or early termination provisions, and the financial exposure if the landlord exercises any termination right.

This needs to be a clean, presentation-ready document that I can share with outside counsel. Use the standard privileged communication header and format it as an appendix to the main CoC summary.

One additional item — for the 14 executive employment agreements with CoC provisions, please prepare a separate analysis showing the aggregate cost of all triggered provisions (accelerated vesting, severance multipliers, COBRA continuation) assuming a hypothetical change of control occurring at various dates in Q2 2025. I need this for the financial modeling work that Priya's team is conducting. Coordinate with Jordan Michaels on the equity valuation assumptions.

Rachel,

Understood on all points. I'll have the highlighted consent list ready by February 28 and will coordinate with Amanda Briggs's team on the customer health data. The executive CoC cost analysis will take a few additional days — I'll need compensation data from HR for the vesting calculations, and Jordan's team will need to provide the current 409A valuation and equity cap table. Targeting March 3 for that deliverable.

Quick question on the executive analysis: should I use the current 409A valuation for equity calculations, or do you want me to model at a range of valuations? The current 409A was set in October 2024 and may not reflect the company's recent performance trajectory.

I'll also flag that the two executive agreements with Section 280G gross-up provisions (Vasquez and Webb) will add meaningful cost if the transaction value triggers the excise tax threshold. I can model that separately if helpful.

Nathan

Use a range: current 409A, 1.5x current, and 2x current. Three scenarios. Yes, model the 280G impact separately for Vasquez and Webb.

And make sure the consent list includes a recommendation on timing — how far in advance of any potential transaction would we need to begin the consent process, and what's the expected timeline for obtaining consents from each counterparty. I want to understand the critical path.

[09:02 AM] amanda.briggs
Good morning team! NPS preliminary results are in and I have some great numbers to share.

NPS preliminary results: 64! Up from 58 last quarter. Rec engine v3 is the #1 cited reason for the improvement.

Here's the full breakdown:
- Survey responses: 142 of 218 customers (65% response rate)
- Promoters: 54%
- Passives: 28%
- Detractors: 18%

:chart_with_upwards_trend:

[09:04 AM] tomas.lindgren
That's a meaningful jump. Six-point NPS increase in one quarter. Do we have the verbatim comments yet? I want to see what people are actually writing.

[09:05 AM] cynthia.morales
Verbatim coding is about 70% done. We should have the full analysis by Monday. I can share the raw positive comments now if that's helpful.

[09:06 AM] amanda.briggs
Let's wait for the full coded version, Cynthia. But here are the preliminary themes from the positive responses:

Top positive driver: rec engine v3 (cited 38 times in open-ended responses)

Full positive theme breakdown:
1. Rec engine v3 accuracy and performance — cited 38 times
2. Customer success team responsiveness — cited 22 times
3. Platform reliability and uptime — cited 19 times
4. API improvements and developer experience — cited 15 times
5. Onboarding experience for new users — cited 11 times
6. Reporting and analytics dashboard — cited 8 times
7. Data quality and completeness — cited 6 times

[09:07 AM] derek.nowak
The API improvements feedback is interesting — we haven't done a major API release since Q3 of last year. Wonder if that's carryover sentiment or if people are noticing the v3 API endpoints specifically.

[09:08 AM] alex.gutierrez
Could be the new GraphQL endpoint we shipped in January. That got some attention on the developer community boards. I saw a few blog posts about it.

[09:09 AM] amanda.briggs
Good question. Alex, can you cross-reference the API comments with actual API usage data? I want to know if the people giving positive API feedback are actually high-volume API users or if it's more of a perception thing.

[09:10 AM] alex.gutierrez
On it. I'll pull the API usage metrics for the 15 accounts that cited API improvements and compare against the broader population. Should have something by tomorrow.

[09:11 AM] amanda.briggs
Now for the other side. Detractor themes: pricing concerns (3 accounts), implementation speed (2 accounts), API documentation (2 accounts).

For pricing, the three accounts are: MegaPort ($92K ACV), Northern Rail ($78K ACV), and FastTrack Logistics ($61K ACV). None are in immediate churn risk based on contract terms, but we should flag them for the next pricing review committee meeting.

[09:13 AM] priya.phan
Northern Rail has been complaining about pricing since their renewal last August. They got a 15% increase and their procurement team is still bringing it up in every single QBR. I think it's become a reflexive thing — the person who approved the renewal internally took heat for not negotiating harder, so they keep raising it to show they're fighting on cost. I don't think it's a real churn risk — they renewed for 2 years and the contract goes through August 2026 — but it does affect our NPS because they'll always score us a 6 on cost-related questions.

[09:14 AM] derek.nowak
MegaPort is a different story. They actually might have pricing pressure — they went through a round of layoffs in January and their new CFO is cutting costs across the board. Their usage has dropped about 20% since December. If they come to us for a downsell, that could be $20-30K ACV at risk.

[09:15 AM] amanda.briggs
Good context. Let's proactively reach out to MegaPort — better to get ahead of a downsell conversation than to be surprised at renewal. Derek, can you schedule a check-in with their ops lead this week?

[09:16 AM] derek.nowak
Already pinged them yesterday, actually. Meeting is set for Monday.

[09:17 AM] alex.gutierrez
I can pull the usage data for those three pricing-concern accounts. If their usage has grown significantly since renewal, we might have a story about value-per-dollar improving even if the sticker price went up. That's been an effective reframe in past QBRs.

[09:18 AM] amanda.briggs
Great idea, Alex. Please do that and share with the CSMs by end of week. Include the usage trend charts — those are always compelling in customer conversations.

The two implementation speed detractors are Quantum Freight and Atlas Marine — both onboarded in Q4 and both had some scope creep during implementation. Implementation team has already flagged these for post-mortem review. Not recurring risk.

The two API documentation detractors are developer-heavy accounts that are building custom integrations. I'll loop in Hannah Choi's product team to see if we can prioritize developer docs for Q2.

[09:20 AM] amanda.briggs
Now, on the red accounts — we have 7% of accounts in red health status. That's approximately 15 accounts. Most are small (under $50K ACV) but two are notable: TransGlobal Logistics and Pacific Freight.

Let's deep-dive on the 7% red accounts on Monday. Tomas, please prep the health scorecards for TransGlobal and Pacific Freight.

[09:21 AM] tomas.lindgren
Will do. TransGlobal's scorecard is mostly updated — they had their QBR last week and it went OK, not great. Their CTO is still evaluating alternatives but the recommendation engine v3 improvements gave us some breathing room. I'll have the full card updated by Friday.

Pacific Freight I'll need to pull some fresh data on. Their last meaningful engagement was three weeks ago and it was not a productive conversation.

[09:23 AM] derek.nowak
Pacific Freight has been very quiet. Their main contact, Diane Xu, moved to a different role internally about six weeks ago and the new person — I think his name is Carlos something — hasn't been responsive. I've sent three emails over the past month and gotten one reply, which was basically "we're evaluating our vendor relationships." Very noncommittal.

[09:24 AM] tomas.lindgren
I heard through the grapevine that Pacific Freight has been talking to Kinaxis. Can't confirm officially, but one of their engineers mentioned it in passing during a support chat last month. Said something like "we might not need this integration much longer" when we were troubleshooting an API issue.

[09:25 AM] amanda.briggs
Flag that in the scorecard. Even if it's unconfirmed, it's worth documenting and tracking. If they're seriously evaluating Kinaxis, we should know our win-back strategy before we lose the account.

[09:26 AM] cynthia.morales
I can pull Pacific Freight's support ticket volume and login frequency for the last 90 days. That usually gives us a good leading indicator of engagement drop-off.

[09:27 AM] amanda.briggs
Yes, please do. Include that in the Monday deep-dive materials.

Deep-dive is scheduled for Monday, February 24, 10:00 AM in the large conference room. Please have all 15 red account health scorecards updated by Friday end of day. Priority focus is TransGlobal and Pacific Freight.

[09:28 AM] priya.phan
For the passives — 28% is still pretty high. Any insight on what would convert passives to promoters? That's 40 accounts sitting in the 7-8 NPS range.

[09:30 AM] amanda.briggs
The passive comments are actually the most actionable category. The top themes from passive respondents are:

1. "Good product but expensive compared to alternatives" — 18 comments
2. "Need better integrations with our existing tools" — 14 comments
3. "Support response times could be faster for critical issues" — 11 comments
4. "Would recommend with caveats about pricing/complexity" — 9 comments
5. "Feature requests not being prioritized" — 7 comments
6. "Reporting could be more customizable" — 5 comments

The integrations feedback is interesting timing given the Axion Labs partnership work that Hannah's team is doing. That integration could move several passives into promoter territory once it ships.

[09:32 AM] alex.gutierrez
I'll add an integration sentiment overlay to the NPS dashboard. We should be tracking whether Axion beta customers have higher NPS scores compared to the rest of the base once the beta launches.

[09:33 AM] amanda.briggs
Perfect. Let's make that a standing metric once the beta goes live. I also want to track NPS movement for any customer who adopts the Axion integration in the first 90 days.

[09:34 AM] cynthia.morales
Want me to set up an automated NPS pulse survey for Axion beta participants? We could do a quick 1-question NPS check at 30, 60, and 90 days post-activation.

[09:35 AM] amanda.briggs
Love it. Let's plan that. Build the survey templates and we'll finalize the timing once we have the beta launch date confirmed.

OK team, great discussion. Key takeaways and action items:
1. :tada: NPS at 64 — celebrate but stay focused
2. Red accounts need immediate attention — Monday deep-dive at 10 AM
3. Alex: pull pricing/value analysis for 3 detractor accounts by Friday
4. Derek: MegaPort check-in scheduled for Monday
5. Tomas: prep TransGlobal and Pacific Freight health scorecards by Friday
6. Cynthia: pull Pacific Freight engagement data (tickets, logins, 90-day trend)
7. Alex: cross-reference API feedback with API usage data
8. Cynthia: design Axion beta NPS pulse survey template
9. Amanda: loop in Product on API documentation feedback

Have a great Thursday everyone! :tada:

[09:37 AM] tomas.lindgren
:saluting_face: On it.

[09:37 AM] derek.nowak
:thumbsup: Good numbers overall.

[09:38 AM] priya.phan
Great numbers! Let's keep the momentum going. The rec engine really moved the needle.

[09:38 AM] alex.gutierrez
Will have the data pulls done by Friday AM. :bar_chart:

[09:39 AM] cynthia.morales
Survey templates coming this afternoon. Happy NPS day! :confetti_ball:


DOCUMENT 3 OF 4
TYPE: Internal Announcement
DATE: February 20, 2025
FROM: Vanessa Kline (VP People)
TO: All Employees
SUBJECT: February Hiring Update + New Office Space

Hello Nextera Team!

I'm excited to share our February people update with some great news about our continued growth and a few upcoming milestones that I hope everyone will participate in.

NEW TEAMMATES

We welcomed 14 new teammates in February! Our headcount is now 416 and growing. We've also secured additional office space on the 13th floor to accommodate our engineering team's growth.

Here's the breakdown of our February hires by department and role:

Engineering (8 new hires):
- 4 Backend Engineers — joining the core platform team, working on the data pipeline and recommendation engine infrastructure
- 2 ML/AI Engineers — joining the machine learning team, focused on model training and optimization for rec engine v4 planning
- 1 Platform Engineer — joining the infrastructure team, focused on Kubernetes operations and cloud cost optimization
- 1 QA Engineer — joining the quality assurance team, focused on automated testing for the API layer

Sales (3 new hires):
- 2 Account Executives — covering the Northeast and Southeast territories
- 1 Sales Development Representative — supporting the enterprise pipeline development team

Customer Success (2 new hires):
- 1 Customer Success Manager — managing mid-market accounts in the logistics vertical
- 1 Technical Account Manager — supporting our largest enterprise customers with implementation and integration projects

Legal (1 new hire):
- 1 Paralegal — supporting the expanded contract review and compliance workload in Rachel Dominguez's legal department

A warm welcome to every one of our new colleagues! If you haven't had a chance to introduce yourself yet, please take a moment to say hello — whether that's stopping by their desk, sending a Slack message, or joining one of the new hire lunch sessions that we organize every other Friday. Our culture of welcoming new teammates is something I hear about consistently in onboarding feedback, and I'd like to keep that reputation strong.

OFFICE EXPANSION — 13TH FLOOR

As many of you have noticed, our 14th floor headquarters has been getting a bit cozy, especially in the engineering wing where we've been doubling up on desks in some of the open-plan areas. I'm happy to announce that we've secured additional space on the 13th floor of our building. Here are the details:

- Location: 13th floor, same building as our 14th floor headquarters
- Space: 8,000 square feet
- Availability: March 1, 2025
- Purpose: Engineering team expansion workspace
- Capacity: Approximately 60 desks, 2 large meeting rooms (12-person each), 4 phone booths, and a small kitchen area with coffee/snack service
- Lease term: 18 months

The 13th floor will primarily house the platform engineering and ML/AI teams, with Marcus Webb's engineering leadership overseeing the space allocation. We chose to keep the engineering teams together rather than splitting across departments to maintain the collaboration dynamics that Marcus's team has built.

Facilities will begin the move-in setup starting next week, including furniture installation, IT infrastructure (networking, monitors, peripherals), and kitchen equipment. We expect the space to be fully operational by mid-March, with a formal "opening day" celebration planned for March 17 (St. Patrick's Day theme — why not?).

A few logistical notes about the 13th floor:
- Building access badges will work for the 13th floor starting March 1. No action needed on your part.
- The 13th floor elevator lobby will have the same visitor check-in process as the 14th floor.
- WiFi network name will be "Nextera-13" and will automatically connect if you're on the Nextera network profile.
- Parking and building amenities (gym, cafe, bike storage) remain unchanged.

The 18-month lease term is shorter than our usual 36-month terms, giving us flexibility as we evaluate our long-term space needs. Our 14th floor headquarters lease runs through 2029, so that remains our primary home base for the foreseeable future.

EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT SURVEY

Our annual employee engagement survey launches March 3. Your feedback matters — please take the 15 minutes to complete it.

Survey details:
- Launch date: Monday, March 3, 2025
- Close date: Monday, March 17, 2025 (two-week window)
- Platform: Culture Amp
- Estimated completion time: 15 minutes
- Anonymity: All responses are anonymous and reported in aggregate only. Results are shared at the team level only when a team has 5+ respondents to protect individual privacy.

Last year's engagement score was 78 out of 100, which placed us in the 72nd percentile among Culture Amp's technology company benchmark. Our goal this year is to maintain or improve that score while addressing the top feedback themes from last year's survey.

Last year's top three improvement areas were:
1. Career development opportunities — employees wanted clearer pathways for advancement and more structured mentorship programs
2. Cross-team collaboration — teams felt siloed and wanted more opportunities to work with colleagues from other departments
3. Meeting load — employees reported spending too much time in meetings and not enough in focused work

Here's what we've done in response to that feedback over the past 12 months:
- Launched the internal mobility program in September 2024 — 7 employees have transferred between departments since launch
- Created the cross-functional project initiative in November 2024 — 3 cross-team projects currently underway (Axion integration, rec engine v3 optimization, and the customer data platform project)
- Implemented "No Meeting Wednesdays" starting January 2025 — early feedback has been positive, with 89% of employees reporting they use the day for focused work
- Added 2 additional professional development days per year (now 5 total) — uptake has been strong, with 42% of employees already using at least one PD day in January

I'm genuinely curious to see if these changes have moved the needle. Please participate — the higher our response rate, the more meaningful the data becomes. Last year we achieved an 85% response rate, and I'd love to beat that this year.

UPCOMING HR DATES

Please add these to your calendars:
- February 28: Q1 performance review conversations due — managers, please ensure you've completed these with each direct report
- March 1: Updated severance policy effective (all employees were notified in January)
- March 3-17: Employee engagement survey open (Culture Amp)
- March 5: Retention Bonus Program final information session (eligible employees only, calendar invite sent separately)
- March 7: Deadline for Q2 goal setting in Lattice
- March 14: Benefits open enrollment reminder — dental plan changes taking effect in April
- March 28: Company anniversary celebration — Nextera turns 9! The events team is planning something special.

FINAL NOTES

A few additional updates that didn't warrant their own announcement:
- The kitchen on 14 is getting a new espresso machine next week. The current one has served us well for 3 years, but it's time for an upgrade.
- Bike commuter count for February: 34 employees (up from 28 in January, thanks partly to the dry weather).

Weekly Operating Metrics Snapshot
Reporting Period: February 14-20, 2025
Prepared: February 20, 2025

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

All key metrics continue to track ahead of plan for Q1 2025. New bookings are at 38% attainment with five weeks remaining in the quarter, consistent with historical pacing. Cash position remains strong at $24.2M with over 13 months of runway at current burn rate. Headcount reached 416 following 14 February hires.

REVENUE AND BOOKINGS

| Metric | WTD | MTD (Feb) | QTD (Q1) | Q1 Target |
|--------|-----|-----------|----------|-----------|
| New Bookings | $410K | $1.82M | $14.1M | $36.8M |
| Expansion Revenue | $190K | $740K | $3.8M | $8.2M |
| Churn | $0 | $145K | $290K | <$600K |
| Net New ARR (MTD) | — | $2.42M | $17.6M | — |

Bookings Analysis:
- Q1 bookings pace: $14.1M of $36.8M quota at day 48 of the quarter (38% attainment)
- Historical Q1 pacing: approximately 55-60% of bookings close in March, the final month of the quarter
- Pipeline coverage for remaining Q1 target: 3.2x ($72.5M weighted pipeline against $22.7M remaining target)
- Largest deal in pipeline: NovaTrans ($1.2M ACV, 60% probability, expected close March 15)
- Average deal cycle time this quarter: 38 days (vs. 42-day historical average)

The $145K churn this month is the Pacific Freight account, which moved to a competitor on pricing. No other accounts are in active churn risk based on current contract terms and health scores, though the customer success team has flagged 15 accounts in red health status for ongoing monitoring.

CASH AND LIQUIDITY

| Metric | Current (Feb 20) | Prior Month End | Change |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|--------|
| Cash & Equivalents | $24.2M | $25.8M | ($1.6M) |
| Accounts Receivable | $8.7M | $7.9M | +$0.8M |
| Days Sales Outstanding | 33 days | 31 days | +2 days |
| Monthly Burn Rate | $1.8M | $1.7M | +$0.1M |
| Runway (months) | 13.4 | 15.2 | (1.8) |

The $1.6M decrease in cash is attributable to three primary factors:
1. 13th floor lease security deposit and initial fit-out costs: $480K
2. Incremental February payroll for 14 new hires (prorated): $320K
3. Timing of vendor payments (AWS quarterly true-up, annual Salesforce renewal): $800K

Cash position remains strong. The vendor payment timing will normalize in March as these are quarterly/annual items. The 13th floor costs are one-time. At the current burn rate of $1.8M per month, the company has approximately 13.4 months of runway, which is above the board-mandated minimum of 12 months.

HEADCOUNT

| Department | Headcount | Open Positions | Feb Hires | Budget |
|------------|-----------|----------------|-----------|--------|
| Engineering | 186 | 14 | 8 | 200 |
| Sales | 72 | 6 | 3 | 80 |
| Customer Success | 48 | 4 | 2 | 55 |
| Product | 32 | 2 | 0 | 35 |
| G&A (Finance, Legal, HR, Ops) | 44 | 4 | 1 | 48 |
| Executive | 14 | 0 | 0 | 14 |
| Marketing | 20 | 2 | 0 | 24 |
| **Total** | **416** | **32** | **14** | **456** |

Engineering headcount: 186 employees, representing 44.7% of total headcount. The 8 engineering hires this month are ahead of plan (target was 6 for February). At the current hiring pace, engineering is on track to reach the budgeted 200 by end of Q2.

The legal paralegal hire was added to support the expanded contract review workload being managed by Rachel Dominguez's legal team. This hire was not in the original 2025 budget but was approved by the CFO as a mid-year addition given workload demands.

OPERATIONAL METRICS

| Metric | Current | Prior Month | QoQ Trend |
|--------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Platform Uptime | 99.99% | 99.97% | Improved |
| Support Tickets (open) | 42 | 51 | Improved |
| Avg First Response Time | 2.1 hours | 2.4 hours | Improved |
| Avg Resolution Time | 14.2 hours | 16.8 hours | Improved |
| Customer NPS | 64 | 58 | +6 points |
| Employee Count | 416 | 402 | +14 |
| Voluntary Attrition (ann.) | 8.2% | 8.5% | Improved |
| Offer Acceptance Rate | 91% | 88% | Improved |

All operational metrics are trending positively across the board. The NPS improvement from 58 to 64 is the largest quarter-over-quarter increase measured in the last three years. The customer success team attributes the improvement to the rec engine v3 launch and sustained investment in customer success staffing.

Support ticket backlog has decreased to 42 open tickets from 51, reflecting both reduced ticket volume and improved resolution efficiency from the support team's process improvements implemented in January.

EXPENSE TRACKING

| Category | February (Est.) | Budget | Variance | Notes |
|----------|----------------|--------|----------|-------|
| Payroll & Benefits | $5.2M | $5.0M | +$200K | 14 hires (2 above plan) |
| Infrastructure (Cloud) | $890K | $850K | +$40K | Usage growth |
| Software & Subscriptions | $410K | $420K | ($10K) | Under budget |
| Office & Facilities | $620K | $380K | +$240K | 13th floor deposit/fit-out |
| Professional Services | $310K | $280K | +$30K | Legal advisory |
| Travel & Entertainment | $140K | $160K | ($20K) | Under budget |
| Marketing | $280K | $300K | ($20K) | Under budget |
| **Total Operating** | **$7.85M** | **$7.39M** | **+$460K** | |

February expenses are $460K above the monthly budget. The primary drivers are the 13th floor office costs ($240K one-time) and incremental payroll ($200K ongoing at higher headcount). These are partially offset by underspend in Marketing, T&E, and Software. The office costs will not recur; payroll will run at the higher rate for the remainder of the year given the incremental headcount.
