APPROVAL OF MINUTES

The minutes of the previous special board session (February 5, 2025, NXS-BOD-2025-SP03) were approved unanimously. There were no corrections or amendments.

AGENDA ITEM 1 — PROJECT LIGHTHOUSE STATUS

Mr. Aldric presented a status update on Project Lighthouse, the company's confidential discussions with Meridian Corp regarding a potential acquisition.

Mr. Aldric reported that Meridian Corp's CEO Gerald Fisk has indicated an intent to present a formal offer in the $900M range following Meridian's board meeting on March 14, 2025. Mr. Aldric noted that his most recent conversation with Mr. Fisk took place on February 23, 2025, and that both parties expressed alignment on timeline.

Key points from Mr. Aldric's update:

1. Meridian Corp has completed its preliminary internal assessment and Mr. Fisk has communicated intent to seek board authorization for a formal offer at the March 14 Meridian board meeting.

2. The expected offer range is approximately $900M, consistent with prior discussions. Mr. Aldric noted that Mr. Fisk has referenced a range of $850M to $950M in prior conversations, with $900M as the most frequently cited midpoint.

3. Mr. Fisk has expressed intent to sign a letter of intent by end of March 2025, contingent on Meridian board approval.

4. Integration planning: Mr. Fisk has communicated that Meridian intends to retain all Nextera engineering employees and maintain the San Francisco office as a Meridian Center of Excellence for supply chain AI. All engineers would receive offer letters as part of the transaction.

5. The relationship between the two companies remains constructive and professional. No material disagreements have arisen during preliminary discussions.

Discussion: Mr. Whitfield asked about Meridian's financing structure. Mr. Aldric deferred to Goldman Sachs. Mr. Caldwell stated that based on publicly available information, Meridian Corp has approximately $2.8B in available credit facilities and $1.4B in cash and equivalents, sufficient to fund an all-cash transaction in the $900M range without requiring additional debt issuance or equity dilution.

Ms. Patel asked about competitive bidders. Mr. Aldric stated that the board's current strategy is to negotiate exclusively with Meridian rather than conduct a broader process. Mr. Stern from Wachtell confirmed that the board's fiduciary duties are satisfied provided the board has sufficient information to evaluate the fairness of any offer, which Goldman Sachs' valuation analysis supports. Mr. Stern noted that the board should periodically reassess whether a broader process is warranted.

AGENDA ITEM 2 — GOLDMAN SACHS PRELIMINARY VALUATION ANALYSIS

Ms. Vasquez presented Goldman Sachs' preliminary valuation analysis for Nextera Solutions, prepared by the Goldman Sachs Mergers & Acquisitions team under the direction of Managing Director Jonathan Caldwell.

Ms. Vasquez presented Goldman Sachs' preliminary valuation analysis indicating a fair value range of $820M to $1.05B based on comparable transactions and DCF analysis.

Methodology and findings:

A. Comparable Company Analysis
Goldman Sachs identified 12 comparable public companies in the supply chain technology and logistics SaaS sectors. The analysis used the following metrics:
- EV/Revenue multiples: range 5.8x to 9.2x, median 7.4x
- EV/ARR multiples: range 6.2x to 9.8x, median 7.8x
- Applied to Nextera's current ARR of $122.4M (as of February 14, 2025)
- Comparable company implied valuation range: $758M to $1.2B
- Selected range (using median multiples and growth-adjusted factors): $820M to $960M

B. Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Goldman Sachs prepared a five-year DCF model based on Nextera's financial plan and management assumptions:
- Revenue CAGR assumption: 22% (FY2025-FY2029)
- Terminal growth rate: 3.5%
- Weighted average cost of capital (WACC): 12.5%
- Terminal value methodology: Gordon Growth Model, cross-checked with exit multiple
- DCF implied enterprise value: $870M to $1.05B
- Sensitivity analysis: $780M (bear case, 18% CAGR) to $1.15B (bull case, 26% CAGR)

C. Precedent Transaction Analysis
Goldman Sachs reviewed 8 precedent M&A transactions in the supply chain technology sector completed in 2023-2025:
- Transaction multiples: range 6.5x to 10.2x ARR, median 8.1x
- Precedent transaction implied valuation: $796M to $1.25B
- Selected range (adjusting for Nextera's growth profile and margin trajectory): $850M to $1.05B

D. Synthesis
Goldman Sachs' preliminary fair value range: $820M to $1.05B
- This represents 6.9x to 8.8x Nextera's current ARR of $122.4M
- Mr. Caldwell noted that this range may be adjusted upward when Q1 results are finalized, as the company is tracking 7% above plan
- Meridian's indicated $900M offer falls within the lower-middle portion of the fair value range

Mr. Caldwell: "Our preliminary analysis supports a fair value range of $820M to $1.05B. The $900M range indicated by Meridian is within our fair value band, though we note it is below the midpoint. As Q1 performance data becomes available, we expect to narrow and potentially adjust this range upward."

Ms. Liu presented additional detail on premium analysis: the $900M midpoint represents a 7.4x ARR multiple, which Goldman Sachs considers reasonable but not aggressive for a company with Nextera's growth rate (22%+ revenue CAGR) and margin profile (79% gross margins). For context, the average premium for comparable transactions was 8.1x ARR.

Discussion: Mr. Kessler asked whether Goldman Sachs would recommend holding for a higher offer. Mr. Caldwell stated that this is ultimately a board decision but noted that the Q1 outperformance, if sustained, would support an argument for a higher valuation. He recommended the board evaluate the formal offer once received and not commit to a specific floor at this time.

Ms. Patel asked about the timing of the formal fairness opinion. Mr. Caldwell confirmed that Goldman Sachs will issue a formal fairness opinion when a definitive offer is received, expected after Meridian's March 14 board meeting. He noted that the preliminary valuation analysis presented today would be refined into a formal fairness opinion letter, which typically requires 5-7 business days of work once a definitive offer is received. The fairness opinion is a prerequisite for the board to approve any definitive agreement.

Mr. Whitfield raised the question of employee disclosure timing. Ms. Dominguez advised that under Delaware law, there is no obligation to disclose to employees until a definitive agreement is signed, but best practice suggests preparation of employee communications in advance. She recommended that VP People Vanessa Kline be briefed on Project Lighthouse approximately two weeks before any planned announcement, to prepare FAQ documents, retention communication, and logistics for an all-hands disclosure event. The board agreed to table the employee disclosure discussion until a formal offer is received.

Mr. Kessler asked about tax implications of the transaction structure. Ms. Vasquez reported that her team is modeling both asset sale and stock sale structures. At $900M, the tax differential between structures is approximately $40M-$60M in aggregate across all stockholders. Goldman Sachs has recommended pursuing a stock sale structure, which is more favorable for existing stockholders. Mr. Stern confirmed that Wachtell is reviewing the structural alternatives and will present a comparative analysis by March 10.

Goldman Sachs engagement terms (for the record):
- Retainer: $500K (paid upon engagement, January 2025)
- Success fee: 0.5% of transaction value (payable upon closing)
- At $900M transaction value, the success fee would be $4.5M
- Total Goldman Sachs compensation at $900M: $5.0M
- Expense reimbursement cap: $75K

AGENDA ITEM 3 — DATA ROOM PREPARATION STATUS

Ms. Dominguez reported on the status of data room preparation for Project Lighthouse.

IV. STAFFING AND COORDINATION

You are authorized to coordinate directly with department heads for document collection:

- HR documents: Vanessa Kline (VP People) and her team
- Technology documents: Marcus Webb (VP Engineering) and Lisa Chen (Director, Platform)
- Customer documents: Amanda Briggs (VP Customer Success)
- Sales documents: Kevin Orosco (VP Sales)

Important: when requesting documents from department heads, use the cover story that these are needed for "annual corporate governance review and insurance renewal." Do not reference Project Lighthouse or any potential transaction. Only you, me, and the executive team are read into the project.

Two full-time paralegals (Jennifer Okafor and Raj Sundaram) are assigned to the data room project through completion. They handle document formatting, redaction of personally identifiable information, and upload to Intralinks.

V. DOCUMENT FORMATTING STANDARDS

All documents must conform to the following standards before upload:
- Format: PDF (searchable, OCR applied to scanned documents)
- Naming convention: [Category Number]-[Subcategory]-[Document Name]-[Date]
- Redactions: PII for non-executive employees, personal contact information, SSNs
- Watermarks: "CONFIDENTIAL — Project Lighthouse" on all pages
- Version control: only final versions; drafts should not be uploaded

Wachtell Lipton will perform a final review of all uploaded documents for privileged content, inadvertent disclosure risk, and completeness. Their review requires 5 business days, which is factored into the March 21 target date. Wachtell has also requested that we flag any documents that reference Meridian Corp by name (there should be none in ordinary course documents, but the check is standard practice).

Intralinks data room access controls:
- Administrator access: Nathan Foley, Rachel Dominguez
- Upload access: Jennifer Okafor, Raj Sundaram (paralegals)
- Read-only access (Nextera side): David Aldric, Priya Vasquez, Maria Fuentes
- Meridian access: NOT YET PROVISIONED (will be configured upon LOI execution)
- Activity tracking: Intralinks logs all document views, downloads, and prints by user
- Access revocation: automatic upon deal termination or mutual agreement

VI. WEEKLY STATUS REPORTING

Please provide me with a weekly status report every Friday by 5 PM PST covering:
- Documents loaded (cumulative count and percentage)
- Category-by-category completion status
- Blockers or delays
- Staffing needs

First status report due: March 7, 2025.

VII. RISK ITEMS

The following risks have been identified and are being tracked:

1. SOC 2 Type II audit overlap: The audit runs March 3-21. Auditors may request documents that are also being collected for the data room. Coordinate with Angela Torres to avoid conflicting requests or alerting auditors to non-routine activity.

2. Engineering documentation lag: Technology category is only 40% complete. Marcus Webb's team is focused on v3 post-launch support and Axion integration. Assign a dedicated engineering writer to document collection for the next two weeks.

3. HR benefits plan complexity: Vanessa Kline's team manages 14 distinct benefit plans across multiple carriers. Document collection requires extracting plan documents, summary plan descriptions, and amendment histories. This is the most labor-intensive category.

To: David Aldric <d.aldric@nextera.io>; Priya Vasquez <p.vasquez@nextera.io>; Marcus Webb <m.webb@nextera.io>; Hannah Choi <h.choi@nextera.io>; Kevin Orosco <k.orosco@nextera.io>; Vanessa Kline <v.kline@nextera.io>; Rachel Dominguez <r.dominguez@nextera.io>
Subject: Q1 Customer Health — Final Update

Executive team,

Here is the final Q1 customer health update for your review. This data is current as of February 25 and incorporates all QBR findings, renewal outcomes, and NPS results through the end of the measurement period.

I. CUSTOMER HEALTH SUMMARY

Q1 health update: 75% green, 19% yellow, 6% red. TransGlobal renewed — they evaluated Kinaxis but our rec engine v3 tipped the decision.

Detailed health distribution:

Green (Healthy — 75%, 166 customers):
- No material risk indicators
- Contract renewal likelihood >90%
- Product adoption metrics at or above target
- Support ticket volume within normal range
- Executive sponsor relationship active

Yellow (Watch — 19%, 42 customers):
- One or more risk indicators present but manageable
- Common risk factors: pricing sensitivity (18 accounts), low feature adoption (12 accounts), executive sponsor turnover (8 accounts), support escalation history (4 accounts)
- Action plans in place for all 42 accounts
- 28 of 42 have scheduled QBRs in the next 30 days

Red (At Risk — 6%, 13 customers):
- Multiple risk indicators or active churn signals
- Combined ACV of red accounts: $1.6M
- CSM intervention active on all 13 accounts
- 4 accounts expected to resolve to yellow within 30 days
- 3 accounts are in active competitive evaluation
- 6 accounts have confirmed renewal dates in Q2 and are being closely monitored

II. KEY ACCOUNT UPDATES

TransGlobal Logistics ($180K ACV):
- STATUS: RENEWED (signed February 24, 2025)
- Background: TransGlobal evaluated Kinaxis during their renewal process. Competitive evaluation lasted 6 weeks.
- Outcome: Renewed with Nextera for 24 months at $180K ACV (no price increase). TransGlobal cited rec engine v3 as the deciding factor. Their VP of Operations, Sandra Ellison, stated: "The v3 recommendation accuracy put Nextera ahead. Kinaxis couldn't match the route optimization results."
- CSM: Tomas Lindgren managed the competitive defense, including two executive-level meetings and a custom v3 proof-of-concept deployment.
- Lesson learned: early identification of competitive threat (flagged in December) gave us 8 weeks to respond. CSM team executed well.

Pacific Freight ($145K ACV):
- STATUS: CHURNED (effective February 15, 2025)
- Pacific Freight churned. $145K ACV loss. They went with Kinaxis on price. Painful but we've backfilled with $240K in expansion from LogiFlow.
- Root cause: Pacific Freight's new CFO (joined November 2024) initiated a vendor cost reduction program. Kinaxis offered a 30% discount for a 2-year commitment. Our attempt to match pricing was declined by the new CFO, who cited a broader preference for Kinaxis' compliance module.
- ACV impact: -$145K net ARR loss recognized in Q1
- Backfill: LogiFlow expansion ($240K ACV) more than offsets the Pacific Freight churn

LogiFlow ($680K ACV, up from $440K):
- STATUS: EXPANDED (signed February 18, 2025)
- LogiFlow expanded by $240K ACV after successful v3 deployment. Their operations team reported a 28% reduction in empty container repositioning costs. The expansion adds 3 new modules: route optimization, demand forecasting, and real-time fleet analytics.
- This is our fourth expansion with LogiFlow in 18 months.

DB Schenker ($740K ACV):
- STATUS: HEALTHY — growing account
- DB Schenker expansion ($420K ACV) from episode 13 is fully onboarded. Customer satisfaction is high. Their analytics team continues to report strong v3 results (35% improvement in European route optimization accuracy).
- Next expansion opportunity: North American operations module ($200K estimated ACV, discussions beginning in Q2)

GlobalShip ($890K ACV):
- STATUS: RENEWED (signed February 20, 2025)
- Renewed at $890K ACV for 36 months. Our largest single renewal this quarter. GlobalShip is our third-largest customer by ACV. No competitive threat identified.

III. RETENTION METRICS
