Subject: Timeline Discussion — Project Lighthouse

Gerald —

Good to speak last Thursday. I believe we can have LOI terms agreed by end of March if your team can turn the financial diligence.

A few things on our end to keep you updated. We are running ahead of plan on Q1 — revenue is tracking 7% above forecast and our NPS score just hit 64, the highest in company history. The recommendation engine v3 is a genuine differentiator in the market and customer adoption is accelerating. I mention this because it has a direct bearing on the valuation conversation — the business is demonstrably stronger today than when we began these discussions in January.

On the operational side, our data room is approximately 60% populated. Rachel Dominguez's team has been assembling documents across all 14 categories. We are targeting a fully loaded data room by mid-March, aligned with your board timeline.

Goldman Sachs has been brought up to speed on the transaction parameters. They are preparing the financial materials your team will need for diligence, including a detailed revenue model, customer cohort analysis, and the IP valuation for the recommendation engine. Wachtell Lipton is handling the legal work on our side.

I'd like to understand your integration plans for our engineering team before we get deeper into the process. Marcus Webb has built an extraordinary team — 186 engineers as of this week — and their continuity is personally important to me.

Let me know your thoughts on timing and integration.

Best,
David

David —

Agreed on timing. Our board meets March 14. Assuming no surprises in the data room, I am prepared to recommend authorization of a formal offer in the $900M range.

I appreciate the Q1 update. The revenue trajectory reinforces our thesis. My team has been tracking Nextera's public metrics — the Gartner placement, the G2 reviews, the customer case studies — and the picture is consistent with what you're describing. The recommendation engine is indeed what caught our attention initially, and the v3 improvements have only strengthened our conviction.

On integration plans: let me be very direct, because I know this matters to you.

Engineering is the crown jewel. Every engineer gets an offer letter. We plan to keep the SF office as a Meridian Center of Excellence for supply chain AI.

Here's how we're thinking about it in more detail:

1. SF Office: We intend to maintain your San Francisco location as a standalone Meridian development center. The working name internally is "Meridian Center of Excellence for Supply Chain AI." We see this as the natural home for the continued development of the recommendation engine and the broader supply chain optimization platform. We would expect to maintain the headcount at current levels or above.

2. Engineering Leadership: We want Marcus Webb to run the SF center. We understand he has a change-of-control provision in his employment agreement, and we're prepared to offer him an enhanced package on top of that. We have a good track record with engineering acquisitions — when we acquired LogicPath in 2022, we retained 94% of their engineering team through the 18-month integration period.

3. Product Continuity: Hannah Choi's product team would continue to drive the Nextera product roadmap within the Meridian portfolio. The Axion Labs integration work you're doing is exactly the kind of partnership that Meridian would support and potentially accelerate through our existing data relationships.

4. Brand: For the first 12-18 months, we would maintain the Nextera brand for the supply chain optimization product. The gradual transition to Meridian branding would be managed carefully to minimize customer disruption.

5. Support Functions: Sales and customer success would be integrated into Meridian's existing go-to-market organization. This is the area where we see the most overlap and where some consolidation would occur over time. Amanda Briggs's customer success team has done excellent work — we've heard great things from shared customers.

6. G&A: Finance, HR, legal, and administrative functions would consolidate into Meridian's corporate structure. This is standard in acquisitions of this size and typically takes 6-9 months.

I recognize that items 5 and 6 involve potential headcount impacts for some employees. Our approach has consistently been to make competitive offers to individuals we want to retain and to provide generous transition packages for those who don't continue. In the LogicPath acquisition, every employee received either an offer or a separation package equal to 6 months' salary.

My diligence team is ready to begin as soon as the data room is available. Our financial advisor (Lazard) has already reviewed the public information and is prepared to move quickly once they have access.

Looking forward to next steps.

Gerald

Gerald —

Thank you for the detailed integration framework. The approach to the SF center and engineering retention is exactly what I needed to hear.

My board is fully aligned at 4-0. Goldman is preparing the financial materials you'll need. Wachtell is handling our side. What are your integration plans for our engineering team?

Apologies — I realize I just repeated the question you already answered. Disregard that line. I drafted this at 6 AM before reading your response fully.

To the substance: your plan for the SF center is compelling. The "Center of Excellence" framing will resonate with the engineering team and gives Marcus a clear mandate. The LogicPath retention number (94%) is noteworthy.

I do want to flag one item for your awareness. We recently restructured our non-executive severance policy, effective March 1, from 2x to 1x base salary. This was a planned corporate governance improvement — not related to any transaction — but it does reduce the company's aggregate severance exposure by approximately $9M. I mention this because it will show up in your financial diligence and I didn't want it to be a surprise without context.

The 4-0 board vote I referenced: Sarah Jiang resigned from the board in January. We are down to four directors. The Nominating Committee has a search underway but it's not a priority given current circumstances. All four remaining directors are fully supportive of pursuing Project Lighthouse.

On timing: I believe we should target LOI execution by March 31, with the definitive agreement in Q2. Data room will be ready for your team by March 14, aligned with your board meeting. Goldman is prepared to issue a fairness opinion once we have a formal offer on the table.

One request: can you share Lazard's diligence request list in advance? It would help us prioritize the remaining data room preparation and avoid any back-and-forth that could slow the timeline.

David

Noted on the severance restructuring. Smart move regardless of context — aligns with industry best practices. We made a similar change at Meridian in 2023.

Lazard's diligence request list will be in your inbox by Tuesday. Standard categories plus some specific items on the recommendation engine IP — they want to understand the training data provenance and any open-source dependencies in the ML stack.

On the $900M range: this reflects our current modeling based on publicly available information. The final number will be informed by the data room review, but I want to be transparent — I see more upside potential than downside at this stage. Your Q1 outperformance may move the range higher.

March 14 board meeting is confirmed. I expect authorization to submit a formal letter of intent by March 17 at the latest.

Talk soon.

Gerald

DOCUMENT 2 OF 3
TYPE: All-Hands Meeting Transcript
DATE: February 23, 2025
SPEAKER: David Aldric (CEO)
SUBJECT: Late February All-Hands — Q1 Progress
LOCATION: Main Auditorium, 14th Floor + Zoom for Remote
ATTENDEES: 355 in-person, 61 remote (416 total)
DURATION: 55 minutes (35 min presentation + 20 min Q&A)

[TRANSCRIPT BEGINS]

DAVID ALDRIC: Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for being here — whether that's in the auditorium or joining us remotely. I see 355 badges scanned in and 61 on Zoom, which means we have essentially full attendance. I appreciate that, especially on a Friday.

Let me start with the headline: Q1 is shaping up to be our best quarter in company history. Revenue up, customers happy, product execution flawless. This is what winning looks like.

I'm going to run through the key metrics and then turn it over to Marcus, Hannah, and Kevin for department updates. Then we'll do our usual Q&A. I've set aside 20 minutes for questions because I know there are topics on people's minds and I want to make sure we have time for them.

[slide change]

REVENUE AND BOOKINGS

Let me start with the numbers. Q1 bookings are tracking at $14.1M as of yesterday. Our Q1 quota is $36.8M, which puts us at 38% attainment at day 48 of the quarter. For those of you who've been here a few years, you know that Q1 is always back-loaded — we typically book 55-60% of the quarter's revenue in March. So at 38% on day 48, we are right on pace.

Kevin's sales team has the strongest pipeline we've ever had. Pipeline coverage for the remaining target is over 3x. I'm not going to jinx it, but I will say: we're in a very good position.

Expansion revenue is at $3.8M quarter-to-date against an $8.2M annual target. That's being driven by some significant upsells — the LogiFlow expansion, DB Schenker, and several mid-market accounts adding capacity.

On churn: we lost Pacific Freight this month. That's $145K ACV. It's painful any time we lose a customer, and Amanda's team did a thorough analysis of what happened there. Price was the primary factor — the competitor came in at a significantly lower price point. Q1 total churn is $290K, well below our $600K annual target cap. Our overall retention metrics remain strong.

PRODUCT UPDATE — MARCUS WEBB, VP ENGINEERING

MARCUS WEBB: Thanks, David. I'll try to be brief because I know you all want to get to Q&A.

Three things from engineering this quarter.

First, rec engine v3. Adoption continues to accelerate. As of this morning, 112 customers have activated rec engine v3. That's 51% of our customer base, up from 78 at the end of January. The feedback has been exceptional — it was the number one positive driver in our NPS survey, cited 38 times in customer comments. Platform stability has been rock-solid at 99.99% uptime for February.

Second, the Kubernetes migration. Lisa Chen's infrastructure team completed the disaster recovery Kubernetes migration ahead of schedule. All three AWS regions are now running K8s 1.29. The total migration took 26 days with zero customer impact. I want to call out Lisa and her team specifically — this was a complex migration involving live traffic rerouting across three regions and they executed it flawlessly.

Third, sprint velocity. Sprint 4 just wrapped and we completed 38 stories and 890 points with zero carryover. That's a 12% increase in velocity quarter-over-quarter and it's the most productive quarter in our history. Our open pull request count is down to 18 from 23 in January, which means we're not just writing more code — we're shipping more code.

I'm incredibly proud of this team. When I look at what 186 engineers are accomplishing, it gives me enormous confidence in our ability to execute on the roadmap.

DAVID ALDRIC: Thank you, Marcus. Hannah?

PRODUCT ROADMAP — HANNAH CHOI, VP PRODUCT

HANNAH CHOI: Thank you. I'll be quick. Two items.

First, we have the Axion Labs integration demo scheduled for this Friday, February 28. This is the dry run — three engineers from Ben Arujo's team will be running through the full integration in our staging environment. The internal demo for the broader team is March 3. If you want to attend the internal demo, there's a calendar invite going out this afternoon.

The Axion integration is one of the most exciting partnerships we've done. For those who haven't been following closely, Axion Labs provides real-time freight market data — pricing, capacity, transit times — for 200+ shipping lanes globally. Integrating their data into our platform gives our customers a unified view of their supply chain with market intelligence built in. The beta is targeting June, with general availability in September.

Second, the Q2 roadmap prioritization is complete. I shared the detailed document on Confluence yesterday, but the highlights are: (1) Axion integration GA, (2) rec engine v4 planning, (3) advanced analytics dashboard, and (4) mobile app for field operations. The rec engine v4 planning is the biggest investment — we're looking at incorporating real-time market signals from the Axion data feed into the recommendation model, which would be a genuine first in the industry.

DAVID ALDRIC: Thank you, Hannah. Kevin?

[slide change]

SALES UPDATE — KEVIN OROSCO, VP SALES

KEVIN OROSCO: Afternoon, everyone. I'll keep this short.

Q1 bookings on track for our best quarter ever. The pipeline is the strongest I've seen in my three years here. We have 15 enterprise deals in late-stage negotiations totaling over $8M in potential ACV. The sales cycle is getting faster — average deal cycle time is 38 days this quarter, down from 42 days historically.

The market is moving in our direction. Supply chain optimization is not a nice-to-have anymore — it's a board-level priority for most logistics and manufacturing companies. Every RFP we see now has AI-driven optimization as a requirement, and that's where we win.

I also want to recognize the three new account executives who joined this month. Welcome to the team — you picked a great time to start.

[slide change]

DAVID ALDRIC: Thank you, Kevin.

CLOSING REMARKS

Let me close with something that I think is important for everyone to hear directly from me.

We are building for the next decade. Every decision I make is about ensuring Nextera's independence and long-term success. I know there's been speculation — let me be direct: we are not for sale.

I understand that in a market like this — where consolidation is happening across the enterprise software landscape — people naturally wonder about what's next for a company like ours. I've seen the Blind posts. I've heard the hallway conversations. And I want to address them head-on.

This company was founded nine years ago — our anniversary is March 28, and I'm told the events team has something special planned — with a vision of transforming how supply chains operate through intelligent automation. That vision has never been clearer or more achievable than it is right now. Our technology is the best in the market. Our customers are happier than they've ever been. Our financial performance is the strongest it's ever been. Why would I sell that?

The answer is: I wouldn't. And I'm not going to.

What I am going to do is keep investing in this business. We're hiring 20+ people in Q2. We just signed a lease for the 13th floor. We're building the Axion partnership. We're planning rec engine v4. These are not the actions of a company that's preparing to be acquired. These are the actions of a company that's building for the next decade.

So please: focus on the work. Focus on shipping great product. Focus on making customers successful. That's what got us here, and that's what will carry us forward.

Now let's do Q&A. I see some hands.

[Q&A SESSION — 20 minutes, 7 questions]

QUESTION 1 (remote, from Emily Park, Marketing):
Q: What's our plan for the industry conference in April? Are we doing a keynote this year?
A: Yes, we've been invited to deliver a keynote at SupplyChainExpo on April 15. Hannah and I will co-present on the Axion integration and the future of AI-driven supply chain optimization. It's a great stage for us.

QUESTION 2 (in-person, from Derek Nowak, Customer Success):
Q: Can you talk about the NPS results? Are we doing anything specific to address the detractor feedback?
A: Great question. NPS hit 64, up from 58. The primary improvement driver is rec engine v3 — our engineering team deserves enormous credit. On the detractor side, Amanda's team identified three accounts with pricing concerns and two with implementation speed concerns. We're doing a deep-dive on the red accounts on Monday. The pricing concerns are isolated to a few specific accounts and don't represent a systemic issue.

QUESTION 3 (in-person, from Jake Morrison, Engineering):
Q: Are there plans to expand the ML team beyond the two new hires? We're getting a lot of inbound interest in the rec engine and the current team is stretched.
A: Marcus?
MARCUS WEBB: We have two ML positions open now and we're looking at adding two more in Q2. The ML team is a priority — the rec engine work is driving measurable customer value and we want to invest ahead of demand. If you know great ML engineers, please refer them.

QUESTION 4 (in-person, from Samira Al-Rashid, Product):
Q: What's the timeline for the mobile app? We've been talking about it for two quarters.
A: Hannah?
HANNAH CHOI: It's on the Q2 roadmap as item number 4. We're targeting a design sprint in April with a working prototype by end of Q2. The initial scope is field operations — warehouse floor visibility and alert management. It won't be a full-featured mobile client for the platform, at least not in v1.

QUESTION 5 (remote, from Brian Teller, Sales):
Q: The retention bonus program mentions qualifying events including change of control. Should we read anything into that?
A: No. These are standard provisions that any well-run company includes. We added IPO as a qualifying event too — does that mean we're going public next week? Of course not.

The retention bonus program was designed to ensure that our key employees are rewarded for their loyalty and their contributions to the company's long-term success. It's a retention tool — that's literally in the name. The "qualifying events" language is standard legal drafting that covers the range of potential corporate events that could occur at any private company. We included change of control, IPO, and asset sales because those are the standard categories. I wouldn't read anything into the specific categories any more than I'd read into the fact that our fire insurance policy covers earthquakes — it doesn't mean we're expecting an earthquake.

Vanessa Kline's team can answer any specific questions you have about your individual agreement. The final enrollment deadline is March 15 and there's an information session on March 5.

QUESTION 6 (in-person, from Lisa Chen, Engineering):
Q: What's the status of the No Meeting Wednesdays experiment? Is it becoming permanent?
A: Vanessa?
VANESSA KLINE (from audience): We're collecting data through the engagement survey that launches March 3. Early feedback is positive — 89% of employees say they use Wednesdays for focused work. We'll make a permanent decision after the survey results are in, but I'd be surprised if we rolled it back given the response.

QUESTION 7 (in-person, from Tomas Lindgren, Customer Success):
Q: Can we get more detail on the Axion integration at the internal demo on March 3? Specifically, I have customers asking about data sovereignty — where does the Axion data live?
A: Hannah?
HANNAH CHOI: Absolutely. The March 3 demo will cover the architecture in detail. Short answer: Axion data is processed in our existing AWS infrastructure — same regions, same encryption, same compliance certifications. We're not sending customer data to Axion's systems. We're pulling market data from Axion into our platform. So from a data sovereignty perspective, it's a data ingestion model, not a data sharing model. Your customers' data stays exactly where it is.

DAVID ALDRIC: Great questions, everyone. That's all the time we have today. Let's finish Q1 strong. Thank you.

[TRANSCRIPT ENDS]

Post-meeting note: Employee sentiment poll conducted at conclusion of all-hands. Results: 58% "very confident" in company direction, 31% "somewhat confident," 8% "neutral," 3% "not confident." The "very confident" percentage is down from 61% at the previous all-hands in early February.

Total meeting duration: 55 minutes (35 min presentation, 20 min Q&A). 7 questions asked. All-hands recording available on Confluence by end of business Monday.

Hey team — sprint 4 retro is done and I want to share the highlights with the broader group.

Sprint 4 retro: velocity up 12% QoQ. 38 stories completed, 0 carryover. This is the most productive quarter in our history.

Full breakdown:
- Stories completed: 38 (target was 35)
- Story points: 890 (target was 820)
- Carryover: 0 stories (first time since Sprint 1 of Q3 2024)
- Bugs shipped to production: 2 (both P3, both resolved within 4 hours)
- Code review turnaround: 3.2 hours average (down from 4.1 hours in Sprint 3)

This is outstanding execution, people. Give yourselves a round of :clap:

[10:17 AM] lisa.chen
And I have some infrastructure news to share!

DR migration done! All three AWS regions now running K8s 1.29. Total migration time: 26 days, zero customer impact.

Here's the summary for those who want the technical details:

Pre-migration state:
- us-east-1: K8s 1.27 on EKS (production primary)
- us-west-2: K8s 1.27 on EKS (production secondary)
- eu-west-1: K8s 1.25 on self-managed (DR)

Post-migration state:
- us-east-1: K8s 1.29 on EKS (production primary) ✅
- us-west-2: K8s 1.29 on EKS (production secondary) ✅
- eu-west-1: K8s 1.29 on EKS (DR) ✅ — migrated from self-managed to EKS

The eu-west-1 migration was the heavy lift. We moved from a self-managed K8s cluster to EKS, which involved:
- Rebuilding 47 deployment manifests for EKS compatibility
- Migrating persistent volumes (3.2 TB of data) with zero downtime
- Reconfiguring the Istio service mesh for the new cluster topology
- Updating all CI/CD pipelines to target the new EKS cluster
- Running parallel deployments for 5 days to validate parity

Total migration duration: 26 days (January 28 — February 23)
Downtime: 0 minutes
Customer impact: 0 incidents
Migration team: 6 engineers (Lisa Chen, Kira Dobreva + 4 infrastructure engineers)

The self-managed eu-west-1 cluster has been decommissioned. We're saving approximately $14K/month in infrastructure costs by moving to EKS managed nodes in that region.

[10:20 AM] kira.dobreva
Huge shoutout to @alex.kumar and @maya.patel for the eu-west-1 parallel deployment work. They volunteered for the overnight shifts during the data migration window and caught a race condition in the persistent volume replication that would have caused data loss. That catch alone justified the parallel deployment approach.

[10:22 AM] sofia.marchetti
Congrats to the whole infra team. Clean K8s 1.29 across all three regions is a big deal. Are we planning to upgrade to 1.30 when it GA's or are we going to stay on 1.29 for a cycle?

[10:23 AM] lisa.chen
We'll stay on 1.29 for at least two full sprints to stabilize. K8s 1.30 is expected to GA in April. We'll evaluate the upgrade path then. The nice thing about being on EKS in all three regions now is that upgrades are much simpler — no more self-managed cluster headaches.

[10:25 AM] marcus.webb
Great work, Lisa. The migration was one of our top infrastructure priorities for Q1 and your team delivered it ahead of schedule and under budget. I'm going to highlight this at the next executive team meeting.

February uptime: 99.99%. That's one unplanned downtime event (4 minutes on February 8, DNS propagation delay during a certificate rotation) in the entire month. Our SLA target is 99.95%, so we're well above that.

[10:27 AM] raj.padmanabhan
On the sprint metrics — the 0 carryover is really notable. We've been tracking carryover as a key health metric since Q3 and this is the first sprint where we hit zero. The code review turnaround improvement (3.2 hours from 4.1) is the biggest driver. The "review-before-noon" initiative is working.

[10:28 AM] marcus.webb
Agreed. The review-before-noon culture change has been meaningful. People are starting their days with reviews instead of starting new work, which unblocks their teammates faster. It's a virtuous cycle.

Open pull requests: 18 (down from 23 in January). Target is to get below 15 by end of Q1.

[10:30 AM] ben.arujo
Jumping in on a different topic — Axion demo prep!

Axion demo prep: I need 3 engineers for the Friday dry run. Who's in?

Details:
- Date: Friday, February 28, 2:00-5:00 PM
- Location: Demo Lab (14th floor, Room 14-C)
- Purpose: Full end-to-end integration test in staging environment
- What I need:
  - 1 backend engineer familiar with the data ingestion pipeline
  - 1 ML engineer who can speak to how Axion data feeds into the rec engine
  - 1 frontend engineer to handle the demo UI and visualization layer

The March 3 internal demo is the public-facing one for the rest of the company. Friday is where we make sure everything works perfectly so there are no surprises on Monday.

[10:32 AM] sofia.marchetti
I can cover the backend/ingestion piece. I've been working on the Axion data pipeline for the last two sprints and know it inside out.

[10:33 AM] raj.padmanabhan
I'll ask Maya from my team to join for the ML portion. She's been doing the feature engineering work for integrating Axion signals into the rec engine model.

[10:34 AM] ben.arujo
Perfect. @sofia.marchetti @raj.padmanabhan — thanks. I'll send a calendar invite with the detailed demo script.

Still need a frontend engineer. Anyone from the UI team available Friday afternoon?

[10:36 AM] kira.dobreva
Not frontend, but I can help with the infrastructure side if you need someone to manage the staging environment during the demo. Want to make sure the K8s cluster doesn't have any resource contention while you're running the full integration.

[10:37 AM] ben.arujo
That would be great, actually. The last time we ran a full integration test, the staging cluster ran out of memory because the Axion data feed volume was higher than our test harness expected. Having SRE support would be smart.

[10:38 AM] lisa.chen
Kira — go ahead. I'll cover the on-call rotation for Friday afternoon.

[10:39 AM] marcus.webb
Love seeing this cross-team collaboration. Ben, sounds like you've got a strong team for the dry run. Let me know if you need anything else.

Last note from me — I want to make sure the Axion demo on March 3 is something the whole company gets excited about. Hannah Choi mentioned it at the all-hands today and there's a lot of interest. Let's make sure the demo tells a compelling story about what this integration means for our customers.

For the March 3 internal demo, I'd like to see:
1. The technical integration (API endpoints, data flow, latency metrics)
2. A customer use case walkthrough (pick one of the beta waitlist customers and show how Axion data would enhance their experience)
3. The product vision — how this fits into the Q2 roadmap and beyond

[10:42 AM] ben.arujo
Great suggestions. I'll update the demo deck to include all three. The customer use case will probably be GlobalShip — they were one of the first to sign up for the beta and their use case maps perfectly to the freight market data integration.

[10:43 AM] marcus.webb
GlobalShip is a great choice. They're one of our largest accounts and their team is very engaged. Perfect demo candidate.

:ship: Let's make it great.

[10:44 AM] sofia.marchetti
:rocket: On it.

[10:44 AM] raj.padmanabhan
:thumbsup:

[10:45 AM] lisa.chen
Not to take away from the Axion excitement, but one more infrastructure item: the 13th floor network setup is scheduled for next week. My team is running the cabling on Tuesday and Wednesday. The space should have full network connectivity by March 1 when the lease starts. WiFi (Nextera-13), wired ethernet at all 60 desks, and the two meeting rooms will have the standard AV setup (Zoom Rooms, whiteboard cameras).

Is there anything special the engineering teams moving down there need? We're speccing the workstations now — standard config is dual 27" monitors, USB-C dock, and 32GB RAM ThinkPads. Let me know if any teams need beefier hardware.

[10:47 AM] raj.padmanabhan
The ML team will need GPU workstations at a few desks — at least 4 machines with NVIDIA A4000 cards for local development and testing. The rest can be standard config.

[10:48 AM] lisa.chen
Noted. I'll add 4 GPU workstations to the procurement order. Anything else?

[10:49 AM] marcus.webb
I think that covers it. Thanks for driving the 13th floor setup, Lisa. Let me know if there are any budget questions — I've already gotten approval from Jordan Michaels for the hardware.

[10:50 AM] kira.dobreva
One more thing — should we set up a dedicated monitoring dashboard for the 13th floor network? We do that for the 14th floor and the data center. Having visibility into network health from day one would be good practice.

[10:51 AM] lisa.chen
Good idea. I'll add it to the setup checklist. We'll use the same Datadog monitoring stack.

[10:52 AM] marcus.webb
OK team, great updates all around. To summarize:
- Sprint 4: best sprint ever, 38 stories, 0 carryover :fire:
- K8s migration: complete, all three regions on 1.29, zero impact :white_check_mark:
- February uptime: 99.99% :chart_with_upwards_trend:
- Axion dry run: Friday Feb 28, internal demo March 3
- 13th floor: network setup next week, ready March 1

Have a great weekend everyone. You've earned it.

[10:53 AM] lisa.chen
:saluting_face:

[10:53 AM] sofia.marchetti
:muscle: Great quarter so far.

[10:54 AM] ben.arujo
See everyone Friday at 2 PM for the Axion dry run! :axe: (closest emoji I could find to Axion)
