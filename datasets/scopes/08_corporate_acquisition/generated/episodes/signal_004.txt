[MEETING BEGINS]

DAVID ALDRIC (CEO): Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining our mid-January update. I know we just had the January all-hands last Thursday, but I wanted to do a quick pulse check on where we stand heading into the second half of the month. We've got updates from Marcus on the Kubernetes migration, Hannah on the Axion Labs evaluation, and Kevin on early pipeline momentum. Then I'll open it up for questions.

Before we dive in — a quick shout-out. I want to recognize the January new hire cohort. Twelve new teammates started this week. Vanessa's team put together an outstanding orientation program and I heard great things from the cohort about their first week. Welcome aboard, everyone. You joined at an exciting time.

I've said it before and I'll say it again: we are building Nextera to be the defining company in supply chain intelligence. Not for a quarter, not for a year — for a decade.

Every hire we make, every product decision, every customer we serve — it all ladders up to that ten-year vision. We are 402 people strong and growing. And every single person in this company plays a role in making that vision real.

Now let me hand it over to Marcus for the K8s migration update.

MARCUS WEBB (VP Engineering): Thanks, David. Quick update on the Kubernetes 1.29 migration. We're on track. Phase 1, the staging environment migration, completed in the first week of January with zero issues. Lisa Chen's platform team ran load tests at 2x peak traffic on the new staging environment and the results were strong: p99 latency at 2x traffic is 340ms, well within our 500ms SLA.

Production migration is scheduled for the February 3-7 maintenance window. The primary cutover will happen on February 5 between 2 AM and 6 AM Pacific. We're targeting zero customer-facing downtime using a rolling migration strategy. The rollback plan has been tested three times in staging and we're confident in our ability to roll back within 15 minutes if we hit any issues.

Engineering headcount update: we're at 142 engineers as of this week with the six new hires from the January cohort. Sprint 1 wrapped up last Friday with 14 stories completed and 340 story points delivered. Sprint 2 kicks off on Monday with priority focus on rec engine v3 performance benchmarks and K8s production migration preparation.

One more thing — the engineering hackathon is coming up February 7-8. Sign-ups open next week. Theme is "supply chain intelligence for everyone." $15K in prizes. Start forming your teams.

DAVID ALDRIC: Thanks, Marcus. Hannah, over to you on Axion Labs.

HANNAH CHOI (VP Product): Thanks, David. As you all know, we announced last week that we're kicking off a technical evaluation of Axion Labs' real-time logistics data feed API. The evaluation officially starts on Monday, January 20, and runs through February 14.

Hannah's team is evaluating a potential data partnership with Axion Labs. This is purely a product play — better data means better analytics for our customers.

A quick primer for those who aren't familiar: Axion Labs is a Series B startup based in Austin, Texas. They've raised about $45 million and have approximately 80 employees. Their core product is a real-time logistics data feed that covers over 340 shipping lanes globally. Our current logistics data providers cover about 220 lanes. So Axion offers a significant expansion in data coverage.

The evaluation team consists of five people: Raj Patel and Tyler Kim from engineering, Ben Arujo from product, Nina Okwu from data science, and myself as executive sponsor. We're going to test API reliability, latency, data quality, coverage breadth, and integration feasibility over the four-week sprint.

If the numbers hold up, we'll move to a partnership discussion. If not, we walk away. Simple as that. This is about product quality — giving our customers the best possible data for supply chain decision-making.

DAVID ALDRIC: Thanks, Hannah. Kevin, pipeline update.

KEVIN OROSCO (VP Sales): Thanks, David. Quick pipeline snapshot. We're 15 days into Q1 and the momentum is strong. Enterprise pipeline is sitting at $18.4M across 34 active opportunities. Weighted pipeline is $7.8M — we need $9.2M to hit Q1 quota.

We're also seeing strong traction in mid-market. Paulo Reyes's team has 52 active mid-market opportunities totaling $6.2M in pipeline. We did have two deals flagged as at-risk due to competitive pricing from Kinaxis in the logistics segment, but we're deploying the competitive displacement playbook and feeling good about our position.

Three new enterprise deals worth highlighting: we signed Maersk, DB Schenker, and Kuehne+Nagel in January's first two weeks. Combined, that's about $580K in new ACV. These are exactly the kinds of logos we want — global logistics leaders who will be reference customers and expand over time.

Sales headcount is at 48, targeting 58 by end of Q1. We have 10 open sales positions and we're actively interviewing for all of them. Time to fill in sales has been averaging 38 days, slightly longer than our company average of 34 days, but the quality of the candidates we're seeing is exceptional.

DAVID ALDRIC: Outstanding. Thank you, Kevin. Now I want to open it up for questions. We've got about 15 minutes.

[Q&A SESSION — 6 QUESTIONS]

EMPLOYEE (Engineering): Marcus, for the K8s migration — will there be any impact on our CI/CD pipelines during the cutover?

MARCUS WEBB: Good question. We've already migrated the CI/CD pipelines to the new K8s cluster in staging, so by the time we do the production cutover on February 5, the pipelines will be running on the new infrastructure. There will be a brief period during the rolling migration where builds might take slightly longer — maybe an extra 2-3 minutes per build — but there should be no functional impact. If you're planning a release for February 5, I'd recommend holding it until after the migration window closes at 6 AM.

EMPLOYEE (Sales): Kevin, are we seeing any impact from the current macroeconomic environment on deal cycles? Some of my prospects are mentioning budget freezes.

KEVIN OROSCO: We are seeing some elongation in mid-market deal cycles — average cycle has gone from about 65 days to 78 days over the last two quarters. Enterprise cycles have been more stable at around 85-90 days. That said, our pipeline coverage ratio is 3.2x against a 3.0x target, so we have enough at-bats to absorb some slippage. The key is qualification discipline — making sure we're spending time on deals that will close.

EMPLOYEE (Customer Success): Amanda's not here, so I'll ask David — any plans to expand the customer success team to handle the growing customer base?

DAVID ALDRIC: Great question. Yes, absolutely. We have two CS hires in the January cohort and we plan to add another three to four CSMs by end of Q1. Amanda and Vanessa are working on the hiring plan. Our CSM-to-account ratio is currently 1:12, and we'd like to bring that down to about 1:10 for enterprise accounts. That means we need to add specialized enterprise CSMs as the customer base grows.

EMPLOYEE (Product): Hannah, if the Axion eval goes well, what does the integration timeline look like?

HANNAH CHOI: If we give a green light after the evaluation ends on February 14, we'd move into partnership negotiations and start integration work in late February or early March. The estimated integration effort is 6-8 engineering weeks with a dedicated team. So we'd be looking at a beta in Q2 and GA in Q3. But that's getting ahead of ourselves — let's see what the evaluation shows first.

EMPLOYEE (Engineering): David, with all the M&A happening in enterprise software, are we worried about being acquired?

DAVID ALDRIC: Absolutely not. We are building, not selling. Our best days are ahead of us.

I get some version of this question almost every week, and my answer is always the same. We are a $120 million ARR company growing at 14% year over year. We have $28 million in the bank and no debt. We have 218 customers who love our product. We have the best engineering team in supply chain intelligence.

Why would we sell? We are building a generational company. Our mission is to be the defining platform for supply chain intelligence — and we are well on our way. I started this company eight years ago with a conviction that the supply chain was the next great frontier for intelligent software, and every quarter, that conviction gets stronger.

So to directly answer the question: no, we are not worried about being acquired because we are not for sale.

EMPLOYEE (Finance): Priya isn't here — can someone speak to the Q1 budget status? Are all departments on track?

DAVID ALDRIC: I'll take that one. Yes, all departments are tracking within budget for January. Priya's team completed the FY2025 budget finalization on January 6 and all department heads have signed off on their allocations. Total operating budget for FY2025 is $108.6 million. We're in the early weeks so there's not much variance to report yet, but I can tell you that January payroll and vendor payments are processing on schedule and cash position is healthy. Priya will give a full financial update at the February all-hands.

DAVID ALDRIC: That's all the time we have today. Thank you, everyone, for your hard work and your commitment to Nextera's mission. We're 15 days into what I believe will be our best year yet. Let's keep executing.

Subject: Vendor Renewal Tracker — Q1 Updates

Team,

Distributing the updated vendor renewal tracker for Q1 2025. We have 18 renewals due this quarter with a combined annual value of approximately $8.2M. I've attached the full tracker spreadsheet; highlights below.

COMPLETED RENEWALS

1. AWS — 3-year commitment, locked in at 8% discount
   - Annual value: $4.2M ($3.86M net of discount)
   - Term: January 2025 — December 2027
   - Discount: 8% off standard pricing (volume-based)
   - Savings over term: approximately $1.0M
   - Status: EXECUTED. Good work, Derek. This was a clean negotiation.

Derek verified the AWS contract renewal terms last week. The 3-year commitment at 8% discount represents our largest vendor relationship and the pricing is favorable compared to the benchmarks we pulled from the Flexera 2024 Cloud Pricing Index.

Standard renewal cadence: we prefer 24-36 month terms to lock in pricing. Anything shorter than 18 months needs VP Finance approval.

IN NEGOTIATION

2. Snowflake — 36-month term in final negotiation
   - Annual value: $2.1M
   - Proposed term: January 2025 — December 2027
   - Discount under negotiation: 12% volume discount
   - Current status: Snowflake has agreed to 10% discount, we're pushing for 12%
   - Expected close: January 22, 2025
   - Note: Our Snowflake usage grew 34% YoY in FY2024 driven by the analytics pipeline expansion. The volume discount is justified.

Angela Torres verified: Snowflake renewal for 36-month term in final negotiation with 12% volume discount.

3. Salesforce — Standard renewal
   - Annual value: $0.9M
   - Proposed term: March 2025 — February 2027 (24-month)
   - Current status: Renewal notice received, standard terms expected
   - Expected close: February 28, 2025
   - Note: Standard CRM renewal. No material changes to scope or pricing expected. We're at 52 sales seats and may need to add 6-8 additional seats by mid-year.

Salesforce renewal scheduled for March with standard 24-month term.

4. Datadog — Monitoring expansion
   - Annual value: $0.6M (up from $0.48M due to infrastructure expansion)
   - Proposed term: January 2025 — December 2027 (36-month)
   - Status: Terms approved by both parties, pending signature
   - Discount: 15% volume discount for 36-month commitment
   - Expected close: January 17, 2025
   - Note: The Datadog expansion covers monitoring for the new Kubernetes infrastructure. The 36-month commitment locks in favorable pricing ahead of their planned price increase in Q2.

Datadog renewal approved at 36-month commitment for monitoring expansion.

UPCOMING RENEWALS (Q1)

5. Confluent (Kafka managed service) — $180K/year, renews February 2025
6. PagerDuty — $72K/year, renews February 2025
7. Greenhouse (ATS) — $84K/year, renews March 2025
8. Figma — $48K/year, renews March 2025
9. Notion — $36K/year, renews February 2025
10. Linear (project management) — $28K/year, renews March 2025
11. LaunchDarkly (feature flags) — $96K/year, renews February 2025
12. MongoDB Atlas — $240K/year, renews March 2025
13. Stripe — $0 (transaction-based pricing, annual review)
14. Segment — $156K/year, renews February 2025

VENDOR PORTFOLIO SUMMARY

Active vendor contracts: 142
Q1 renewals due: 18
Total annual vendor spend: $14.8M
Largest vendor: AWS ($4.2M/year)
Second largest: Snowflake ($2.1M/year)
Third largest: Salesforce ($0.9M/year)
Fourth largest: Datadog ($0.6M/year)
Standard contract term preference: 24-36 months

Year-over-year vendor spend comparison:
- FY2024 total vendor spend: $14.8M
- FY2023 total vendor spend: $12.1M
- YoY increase: $2.7M (22%)
- Primary drivers of increase: AWS usage growth (+$0.9M), Snowflake usage growth (+$0.6M), new vendor additions (+$0.8M), general price increases (+$0.4M)

I'll circulate updated tracker weekly through Q1. Derek, please keep the master spreadsheet in the shared Finance drive updated as negotiations progress. Jordan, let me know if you need anything else for the board package.

Additionally, for the board package: I'm preparing a vendor concentration analysis that shows our dependency on top vendors by spend. Current breakdown:

- AWS: $4.2M (28.4% of total vendor spend)
- Snowflake: $2.1M (14.2%)
- Salesforce: $0.9M (6.1%)
- Datadog: $0.6M (4.1%)
- All others combined: $7.0M (47.3%)

Our top vendor (AWS) represents 28% of total vendor spend, which is within the 30% concentration threshold recommended by our auditors. No single vendor represents a critical dependency risk that isn't mitigated by available alternatives.

Payment terms across our vendor portfolio:
- Net 30: 89 contracts (63%)
- Net 45: 31 contracts (22%)
- Net 60: 14 contracts (10%)
- Prepaid annual: 8 contracts (5%)

Total prepaid balances as of January 15: $3.8M across all vendors with prepaid terms. These are amortized monthly over the contract term per our standard accounting procedures.

For reference, our vendor approval workflow requires:
- Contracts under $25K: Manager approval
- Contracts $25K-$100K: VP approval
- Contracts $100K-$500K: CFO approval
- Contracts over $500K: CEO + CFO approval
- All contracts over 24 months: VP Finance review for term appropriateness

Please direct any questions about specific vendor renewals to me or Derek.

Subject: RE: Vendor Renewal Tracker — Q1 Updates

Angela,

Thanks for the comprehensive update. A few notes from my side:

1. AWS renewal — confirmed, the 8% discount is locked in and the contract is fully executed. I've uploaded the signed agreement to the contracts folder in SharePoint.

2. Snowflake — I have a call with their enterprise account team tomorrow at 2 PM. I'm confident we can get to 12% given our growth trajectory. They know we're their largest customer in the supply chain vertical and they don't want to lose the reference account. I'll update the tracker by end of week.

3. Datadog — I'll pick up the signed contract from legal tomorrow. Nathan Foley reviewed the terms last week and approved with no changes.

4. MongoDB Atlas — heads up that their renewal team has been pushing for a price increase of approximately 15%. Our current contract locks us at $240K but they want $276K for the renewal. I'm pushing back with usage data showing our MongoDB spend per compute unit is already above market. Will keep you posted.

5. I've also started the quarterly revenue waterfall model that Priya requested. First draft should be ready by January 20.

Question for you: on the standard term preference of 24-36 months — Jordan mentioned that we should standardize all new commitments at 24 months minimum. Are there exceptions? Some of the smaller vendors (sub-$50K/year) are only willing to offer 12-month terms.

Subject: RE: Vendor Renewal Tracker — Q1 Updates

Derek,

Good points all around. On the term preference: yes, for vendors under $50K/year, a 12-month term is acceptable without VP Finance approval. The 24-36 month preference applies to vendors above $50K/year where we want to lock in pricing and avoid annual renegotiation overhead.

On MongoDB — push back hard. A 15% increase is above market. Pull the Flexera benchmarks and our actual usage metrics. If they won't budge below 10%, let's schedule a call with Jordan to discuss whether we should evaluate alternatives (Amazon DocumentDB, for instance). We have leverage here.

[10:30 AM] frank.gutierrez
@channel SOC 2 Type II audit preparation update. I want to make sure everyone is tracking on timelines and deliverables.

**SOC 2 AUDIT TIMELINE:**
- Audit window: March 3 - March 21, 2025
- Ernst & Young on-site: March 3-7
- Remote review: March 10-21
- Final report expected: April 15

This is our annual SOC 2 Type II audit. Last year we received a clean opinion with zero findings — let's keep that streak going.

SOC 2 audit window is March 3-21. E&Y will be on-site March 3-7. All teams: please ensure your access reviews are current.

**PREPARATION CHECKLIST:**

All engineering teams:
- [ ] Access control reviews: verify all team members have appropriate role-based access. Remove any access for departed employees or role changes.
- [ ] Code review documentation: ensure all production deployments have documented peer review approvals in GitHub.
- [ ] Change management tickets: verify all production changes have associated JIRA tickets with approval chains.
- [ ] Incident response procedures: review and update runbooks in Confluence.

Platform team (@lisa.chen):
- [ ] Verify all access control logs are retained for 12 months per our data retention policy. Confirm log integrity with checksums.
- [ ] Prepare infrastructure inventory document showing all production systems, data stores, and network topology.
- [ ] Document the Kubernetes 1.29 migration as a significant infrastructure change for the auditors.

Security team:
- [ ] Update the risk register with any new risks identified in Q4.
- [ ] Complete the annual vulnerability assessment summary.
- [ ] Prepare the penetration test report from the upcoming February test for auditor review.

[10:38 AM] lisa.chen
@frank.gutierrez All access control logs confirmed retained for 12 months. We migrated to the new log aggregation system (Datadog Logs) in November and have verified retention back to February 2024. Checksums are generated daily and stored in S3 with versioning enabled.

One question: the K8s migration will change our infrastructure topology significantly. Should I prepare a "before and after" architecture diagram for the auditors, or will they want to see just the current state at audit time?

[10:42 AM] frank.gutierrez
Good question. Prepare both — the pre-migration architecture (current), the post-migration target, and a migration plan document showing the transition steps. E&Y will want to see how we managed the infrastructure change, including the rollback plan and the testing methodology. This is actually a good story for us — it shows mature change management.

[10:45 AM] frank.gutierrez
Also — PENETRATION TEST UPDATE.

Pen test is scheduled for Feb 10-14. @lisa.chen please coordinate with the platform team to ensure staging environment mirrors prod exactly.

Penetration test vendor: CrowdStrike (same as last year)
Test scope: external network, web application, API endpoints, mobile app, social engineering
Test environment: staging (must mirror production configuration)
CrowdStrike team size: 3 testers
Kickoff call: February 7, 2025

Last year's pen test results:
- Critical findings: 0
- High findings: 0
- Medium findings: 2 (both remediated within 30 days)
- Low findings: 5 (4 remediated, 1 accepted risk with compensating control)
- Overall security posture rating: "Strong"

Current open security vulnerabilities: 3 low severity, 0 medium, 0 high, 0 critical.

The 3 low-severity findings are:
1. TLS 1.0 still enabled on one legacy internal endpoint (remediation scheduled for K8s migration)
2. HTTP security headers missing on two internal-only admin pages
3. Session timeout on internal wiki set to 8 hours (policy is 4 hours)

All three are scheduled for remediation in Q1. None will be flagged by E&Y for SOC 2 purposes as they are internal-only systems and have compensating controls in place.

[10:52 AM] lisa.chen
Confirmed — I'll coordinate with CrowdStrike on the staging environment. We'll have the post-K8s staging environment ready by Feb 3, which gives us a full week before the pen test starts.

One note: the staging environment currently has 94 EC2 instances mirroring production. After the K8s migration, it will be running on EKS with approximately 45 node groups. The pen test surface area will be different, which is actually a benefit — fewer exposed instances, more containerized workloads with tighter security profiles.

[10:56 AM] raj.patel
@frank.gutierrez Question from engineering: the recommendation engine v3 introduces a new API surface (12 new endpoints). Should these be included in the pen test scope?

[11:01 AM] frank.gutierrez
Yes, absolutely. I'll update the CrowdStrike scope document to include the rec engine v3 API endpoints. Raj, can you provide me with the OpenAPI spec for the new endpoints by January 20? I'll share it with the CrowdStrike team during the kickoff prep.

[11:04 AM] raj.patel
Will do. I'll have the OpenAPI spec ready by Jan 20.

[11:08 AM] frank.gutierrez
Our security team headcount is 6 — myself, two security engineers, one compliance analyst, one security operations analyst, and one GRC specialist. We're lean but effective. If anyone needs support on SOC 2 preparation items, please reach out to the compliance team via #security-compliance or email security@nextera.io.

Remember: data retention policy is 12 months for access logs, 7 years for financial records. If you're unsure about retention requirements for your team's data, check the data classification policy on the intranet or ask in this channel.

[11:15 AM] sami.okoro
@frank.gutierrez Just a note — I've completed the access review for the recommendation engine team. All 18 engineers have appropriate access levels. Two former team members who moved to other teams had their rec engine production access revoked in December. Documentation updated in JIRA.

[11:18 AM] frank.gutierrez
:white_check_mark: Thanks, Sami. That's exactly the kind of proactive cleanup we need. Everyone else — please complete your team access reviews by January 31.

[11:22 AM] frank.gutierrez
Final item — COMPLIANCE TRAINING.

As Rachel Dominguez mentioned in her Q1 legal priorities email, compliance training for all people managers is mandatory between January 20 and February 7. This is separate from the annual security awareness training that I'll announce later this month.

The security awareness training will cover:
- Phishing identification and reporting (updated scenarios for 2025)
- Data handling and classification procedures
- Password hygiene and multi-factor authentication best practices
- Social engineering awareness (including voice phishing / vishing)

Last year we ran a phishing simulation campaign with a 4.2% click rate — that's top quartile for our industry peer group. Goal for 2025: get below 3%. We'll run the first simulation in February after the training is complete.

[11:28 AM] lisa.chen
On the infrastructure documentation for E&Y — I'm also preparing a comprehensive summary of our backup and disaster recovery procedures. With the K8s migration, our DR architecture is changing from warm standby EC2 instances to containerized failover across three AWS regions (us-west-2, us-east-1, eu-west-1). The DR migration is scheduled for March, which means E&Y will be auditing us during the transition period. I want to make sure we have documentation covering both the current and target state.

Backup summary for current architecture:
- Database backups: hourly snapshots to S3, cross-region replication
- Application state: continuous replication via RDS Multi-AZ
- Backup retention: 90 days for daily, 7 days for hourly
- Last DR test: November 14, 2024 (successful, RTO achieved: 22 minutes vs 30-minute target)
- Next DR test: March 2025 (post-K8s migration)

[11:35 AM] frank.gutierrez
Excellent, Lisa. That's exactly the level of detail we need. Please put together the DR documentation package by February 14 so we have time to review it with Wachtell — err, I mean with our auditors at E&Y — before the March audit window.

[11:38 AM] lisa.chen
Will do. I'll have the full package ready by Feb 14.

[11:40 AM] raj.patel
Quick question on the phishing simulation — will it target the engineering team specifically this time? Last year the simulation was pretty generic. I'd love to see something tailored to how engineers might get targeted, like fake GitHub notification emails or spoofed CI/CD alerts.

[11:44 AM] frank.gutierrez
Great suggestion. I'll work with KnowBe4 to create engineering-specific phishing scenarios. Fake GitHub notifications, fake Slack integration alerts, fake Datadog alerts — those are all realistic vectors. The simulation will be customized by department this year.

[11:47 AM] sami.okoro
Also worth noting — with the hackathon coming up Feb 7-8, we should make sure any hackathon projects that touch production data go through the standard data access request process. Last year someone's hackathon project pulled customer data into a non-approved environment. Let's not repeat that.

[11:50 AM] frank.gutierrez
Agreed. I'll send a separate announcement to the hackathon organizers with data handling guidelines for hackathon projects. Good catch, Sami.

NEXTERA SOLUTIONS
SALES TEAM MEMORANDUM

To: All Sales Team Members
From: Kevin Orosco, VP Sales
Date: January 15, 2025
Re: Q1 Sales Kickoff Recap and Pipeline Priorities

Team,

Thank you to everyone who participated in the Q1 Sales Kickoff last Friday. It was our best kickoff yet — great energy, sharp presentations, and strong alignment on our Q1 goals. I want to recap the key takeaways and lay out our priorities for the next 11 weeks.

Q1 QUOTA AND TARGETS

Our Q1 quota is $36.8M in new ARR across the entire sales organization. Here's how that breaks down:

Enterprise (Diana Marsh's team):
- Team quota: $24.2M
- Active AEs: 18
- Average individual quota: $1.34M
- Pipeline required (at 31% win rate): $78M
- Current pipeline: $18.4M across 34 active opportunities
- Weighted pipeline: $7.8M

Mid-Market (Paulo Reyes's team):
- Team quota: $12.6M
- Active AEs: 14
- Average individual quota: $0.9M
- Pipeline required (at 38% win rate): $33.2M
- Current pipeline: $6.2M across 52 opportunities

Average deal sizes:
- Enterprise: $185K ACV
- Mid-Market: $62K ACV

Average sales cycle:
- Enterprise: 85-90 days
- Mid-Market: 65-78 days (note: elongation from macroeconomic factors)

Overall win rate: 31% (trailing 12 months)

Pipeline coverage ratio: 3.2x (target: 3.0x minimum)

COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

Our primary competitive threats this quarter:

1. Palantir — Increasingly aggressive in mid-market pricing. They're offering sub-$500K deals with heavy discounting. Our win rate against Palantir is 62% and improving, but we cannot be complacent. The updated competitive battle card is available in Highspot.

2. Kinaxis — Strong in manufacturing-focused supply chain. We're seeing them in 3-4 enterprise deals per quarter. Our differentiation: rec engine v3, real-time analytics, and broader logistics data coverage. Battle card updating this week — I've asked product marketing to include the Axion Labs data partnership angle once it's announced.

3. Blue Yonder — Less frequent competitor but they have deep relationships in retail. Keep an eye on them in any retail vertical deals.

NEW LOGO HIGHLIGHTS

Three major new logos signed in January's first two weeks:

1. Maersk — $210K ACV, 2-year term. Enterprise. Global logistics leader. Signed by Sarah Kim (Enterprise AE). This is a marquee logo that will open doors across the logistics vertical.

2. DB Schenker — $195K ACV, 2-year term. Enterprise. German logistics giant. Signed by Chris Nadal (Enterprise AE). Our first major European logistics customer.

3. Kuehne+Nagel — $175K ACV, 3-year term. Enterprise. Swiss-headquartered logistics company. Signed by Diana Marsh (closing directly). Another tier-1 logistics logo.

Combined: $580K in new ACV from three reference-quality customers. Outstanding execution.

PROCESS REMINDERS

- All opportunities must be updated in Salesforce by end of day Friday each week. No exceptions.
- Forecast calls are every Monday at 9 AM. Come prepared with your top 5 and any deals that have changed stage.
- Competitive situations must be flagged in Salesforce using the "Competitor" field. Product marketing needs this data for battle card updates.
- Demo environment access: if your demo environment is not reflecting rec engine v3 features, contact Sami Okoro's team for an update.

Let's have a monster Q1. The product has never been better, the pipeline is healthy, and we have momentum. Now let's go execute.

PRESIDENT'S CLUB UPDATE

A quick reminder: President's Club 2025 qualification starts this quarter. Destination is Maui, Hawaii, September 15-19. Top 10% of quota attainment qualifies. We've also added a new category for highest expansion revenue — so if you're great at growing existing accounts, you have a shot at Maui too. Minimum quota attainment for consideration is 120%. Last year 8 reps qualified — let's see 12+ this year.

Full details were sent to the team on January 18. Talk to Diana or Paulo if you have questions about the qualification criteria.

SALES ENGINEERING SUPPORT

Quick note on SE capacity: we currently have 8 sales engineers supporting 32 quota-carrying AEs. That's a 1:4 ratio, which is tight. I've approved two additional SE hires and we're actively interviewing. In the meantime, please submit SE requests at least 5 business days before your scheduled demo or POC kickoff. Priority will be given to enterprise deals over $100K ACV that are in the evaluation stage.

SE utilization in Q4 was 91%, meaning our SEs were fully booked 91% of available hours. Industry benchmark is 75-80%. We're running hot and the additional hires will bring us back to a sustainable pace.
