NEXTERA SOLUTIONS — WEEKLY PIPELINE REVIEW
WEEK OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2025
Prepared by: Marcus DeWitt, Director Enterprise Sales
Date: September 30, 2025
Attendees: Marcus DeWitt, Rina Vasquez (Enterprise AE, West), Jake Thornton (Enterprise AE, Central), Aisha Obi (Enterprise AE, East), Tom Okafor (Head of Revenue Operations)
Document Classification: Internal — Sales Confidential

1. Q3 FINAL RESULTS

Q3 2025 closed on September 30, 2025. Final results:

    Q3 bookings target: $9.2M
    Q3 bookings actual: $9.45M
    Q3 attainment: 102.7%

The quarter finished above target driven by the BrightPath Health Systems deal closing on September 27, two days ahead of the projected signature date. The $9.45M result represents the strongest Q3 performance in Nextera's history, exceeding the prior Q3 record of $8.1M set in 2024.

Total Q3 deals closed: 15 (the 14 deals tracked through September 23 plus BrightPath).
    New logos: 8
    Expansions: 7
    Average deal size (including BrightPath): $630K ACV

Rina Vasquez provided the following update on BrightPath: "BrightPath is done. Signed Friday afternoon. Their CEO called David personally to say thanks — apparently the POC results went to their board."

BrightPath Health Systems Deal Summary:
    ACV: $750,000
    Term: 24 months
    Modules: Core platform, anomaly detection, supplier risk, demand planning (4 modules — the largest module count for a single new logo deal in Q3)
    Seats: 600 (covering supply chain, procurement, and operations teams across BrightPath's 14 hospitals)
    Sales cycle: 6 months (from initial discovery call in March 2025)
    AE: Rina Vasquez
    Champion: VP Supply Chain, BrightPath
    Economic buyer: CFO, BrightPath
    Key differentiator: POC results demonstrated 31% improvement in medical supply demand forecast accuracy versus BrightPath's existing manual forecasting process. The BrightPath CFO presented the POC results to their board of directors as part of a supply chain modernization initiative.

2. Q4 2025 PIPELINE UPDATE

The Q4 pipeline has been updated to reflect Q3 close activities, new pipeline additions from September, and stage progression from deal reviews conducted this week.

Q4 Pipeline Summary:
    Q4 bookings target: $14.8M
    Q4 pipeline (unweighted): $49.8M (up from $47.1M as of September 23)
    Q4 pipeline (weighted): $16.2M
    Q4 pipeline coverage: 3.4x (up from 3.2x, driven by Atlas and Pinnacle additions)

The pipeline increase of $2.7M unweighted from last week is attributable to two new opportunities entering the pipeline: the Fortune 500 logistics deal codenamed "Atlas" and Pinnacle Foods International.

3. KEY DEAL UPDATES BY ACCOUNT EXECUTIVE

3.1 Aisha Obi — East Region

Fortune 500 Logistics Company, Codename "Atlas"
    Stage: 3 (Technical Evaluation / POC)
    ACV: $1,200,000
    Term: To be determined (POC first)

Aisha Obi provided the following update: "Atlas is a top-5 global logistics company. I can't name them yet but this would be our largest single deal ever if it converts. POC starts Oct 13."

Atlas Deal Details:
    The prospect is a Fortune 500 global logistics and freight forwarding company (name restricted to codename "Atlas" per NDA). Nextera was introduced through an executive referral from an existing customer (details restricted). Atlas is evaluating Nextera for supply chain visibility and disruption management across their global distribution network.

    POC Scope: 12-week proof of concept beginning October 13, 2025. The POC will cover 8 of Atlas's distribution centers across North America. The scope includes integration with Atlas's SAP TM (Transportation Management) system, real-time freight tracking data from their telematics platform, and historical disruption analysis using 24 months of shipment data.

    POC Success Criteria: Atlas has defined the following criteria for a successful POC: (a) demonstrated ability to predict shipment delays at least 48 hours in advance with 80% accuracy; (b) integration with their SAP TM instance within the first 4 weeks; (c) dashboard usability validated by Atlas's regional logistics managers at 3 distribution centers.

    Competitive Landscape: Atlas is evaluating Nextera alongside one incumbent vendor (FourKites) and one additional challenger (project44). Nextera's differentiation is the combined supply chain analytics plus anomaly detection capability — the other vendors provide visibility but not predictive analytics.

    Deal Timeline: POC runs October 13 through January 9, 2026. If successful, commercial negotiation would begin in January with a target close of Q1 2026. The $1.2M ACV is based on Atlas's preliminary sizing (8 distribution centers, 2,400 supply chain analysts and operations managers as named users) and may increase if Atlas expands the scope to their European and Asia-Pacific distribution centers.

    Resource Requirements: The POC will require 1 dedicated sales engineer, 0.5 FTE from the integration team for the SAP TM integration, and weekly executive touchpoints with David Aldric for the first 4 weeks.

3.2 Jake Thornton — Central Region

Orion Semiconductor
    Stage: 3 (Technical Evaluation / POC Results)
    ACV: $520,000
    Term: 24 months

Jake Thornton reported: "Orion's POC showed 28% better lead time prediction versus their in-house model. Their CTO wants to present results to their board in October."

Orion Semiconductor POC Results:
    Orion is a semiconductor component manufacturer with fabrication facilities in Austin, TX and Penang, Malaysia. They deployed a 6-week POC of Nextera's core platform and anomaly detection module, focusing on component lead time prediction for their top 200 SKUs.

    Results: Nextera's model achieved a 28% improvement in component lead time prediction accuracy compared to Orion's existing in-house forecasting model. Specifically:
        Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) for Nextera: 8.2%
        MAPE for Orion's in-house model: 11.5%
        Improvement: 28.7% reduction in forecasting error

    The POC also identified 3 previously undetected supplier risk patterns in Orion's Tier 1 supply base, including a concentration risk where a single logistics provider handled 44% of Orion's inbound component shipments from Southeast Asia.

    Next Steps: Orion's CTO has requested a formal business case document from Jake to support a board presentation in October. The board meets on October 15. If the board approves the purchase, Orion expects to move to commercial negotiation in November with a target close by end of Q4. The $520K ACV includes the core platform and anomaly detection module for a 24-month term.

3.3 New Pipeline — Pinnacle Foods International

    Stage: 1 (Discovery)
    ACV: $680,000 (estimated)
    Source: Inbound from Vertex Cloud marketplace trial

Tom Okafor provided context on this opportunity: "Pinnacle came through Vertex Cloud. That marketplace listing is already generating quality leads — this is the third conversion."

Pinnacle Foods International Details:
    Pinnacle is a multinational food and beverage manufacturer with 11 manufacturing plants across the United States, Mexico, and Brazil. Annual revenue: approximately $2.3B. Pinnacle discovered Nextera through a trial listing on the Vertex Cloud marketplace, where Nextera offers a limited free trial of the core platform with sample data. Pinnacle's VP of Supply Chain activated the trial on September 18 and submitted a contact request through the marketplace on September 25 after spending approximately 8 hours exploring the trial instance.

    Pinnacle's stated needs include: supply chain visibility across their 11 manufacturing plants, raw material supplier risk monitoring (Pinnacle sources agricultural commodities from 400+ suppliers across 18 countries), and demand planning for seasonal product lines. The $680K ACV estimate is based on the comparable deal size for food and beverage companies of Pinnacle's size and complexity.

    Discovery Call: Scheduled for October 2, 2025, with Pinnacle's VP Supply Chain and Head of Procurement. Aisha Obi will lead the call (Pinnacle's US headquarters is in Edison, NJ, within the East region territory).

    Vertex Cloud Marketplace Performance: The marketplace listing has been live since July 2025 and has generated 47 trial activations, 12 contact requests, and 3 qualified pipeline opportunities (including Pinnacle). The marketplace operates on a 15% revenue-share model for customers acquired through the channel.

4. PIPELINE DETAIL — STAGE PROGRESSION

The following deals progressed between stages during the week of September 29:

    Advanced to Stage 4 (Procurement/Legal):
    — Coastal Pacific Industries: $390K ACV, manufacturing. Moved from Stage 3 after budget confirmation from their CFO on September 27. Legal review expected to take 2-3 weeks.

    Advanced to Stage 3 (Business Case/Budget):
    — Silverline Healthcare: $440K ACV, healthcare supply chain. Completed technical evaluation with positive results. Silverline's procurement team has begun the budget request process targeting their November fiscal period.

    Advanced to Stage 2 (Technical Evaluation):
    — Three opportunities totaling $1.1M unweighted ACV advanced from Discovery to Technical Evaluation. Each has scheduled a technical deep-dive session with Nextera's sales engineering team in October.

    Closed Lost:
    — One Stage 2 opportunity ($280K ACV) closed lost. The prospect, a mid-size chemical distributor, decided to extend their existing SAP IBP license rather than adopt a new platform. The loss was attributed to the prospect's IT team preference for consolidating on existing SAP investments.

5. REVENUE OPERATIONS METRICS

Tom Okafor presented the following operational metrics for the sales team:

    Q3 Final Win Rate: Enterprise 34%, Mid-Market 41%, Blended 37%
    Q3 Average Sales Cycle: Enterprise 112 days, Mid-Market 68 days
    Q3 Average Deal Size: $630K (enterprise), $185K (mid-market)

    Pipeline Generation (September):
    — Enterprise: $8.4M new pipeline created (15 new opportunities)
    — Mid-Market: $5.2M new pipeline created (28 new opportunities)
    — Total: $13.6M new pipeline in September

    Pipeline Velocity (30-day rolling):
    — Enterprise: $94K/day (calculated as pipeline value x win rate / cycle length)
    — Mid-Market: $42K/day

    Q4 Forecast Model:
    — Commit: $5.8M (deals in Stage 4-5 with verbal confirmation)
    — Best Case: $4.2M (deals in Stage 3 with positive signals)
    — Upside: $6.2M (deals in Stage 1-2 that could accelerate)
    — Total Forecast (weighted): $10.7M (Commit x 90% + Best Case x 50% + Upside x 15%)

    Note: The weighted forecast of $10.7M against a $14.8M target indicates that Q4 will require continued strong pipeline conversion and progression of several Best Case deals to Commit status during October and November. The gap between the current weighted forecast and the target is normal at this point in the quarter — Q3 showed a similar gap at the same point and closed at 103% of target.

6. NEXT STEPS

    October 2: Pinnacle Foods discovery call (Aisha)
    October 8: Orion board prep call (Jake)
    October 13: Atlas POC kickoff (Aisha)
    October 15: Orion board meeting (decision expected)
    October 20: Weekly pipeline review — early Q4 checkpoint

The team's Q4 priority is to convert the Atlas POC, close Lindenfeld Pharma (Q4 commit, $1.1M), and advance 3+ Stage 3 deals to Stage 4 by mid-November. Marcus will schedule 1:1 deal strategy sessions with each AE during the week of October 6 to develop account-specific close plans.

EMAIL THREAD: AXION LABS CONNECTOR — CUSTOMER FEEDBACK SUMMARY

From: Vanessa Kim <vkim@nextera.io>
To: Head of Product <product@nextera.io>

Subject: Axion Labs Connector — Customer Feedback Summary

Hi team,

I've compiled the feedback from all 3 beta customers on the Axion Labs real-time data connector. The beta program ran for 6 weeks (August 18 through September 28) and the results are ready for review ahead of the GA decision.

BETA PROGRAM OVERVIEW

The Axion Labs real-time data connector replaces batch-based data synchronization with streaming data delivery for customers who need sub-second latency on supply chain data updates. The connector was developed jointly by Nextera and the Axion Labs partner engineering team over a 4-month development sprint (May through August 2025). The connector sits between customer source systems and the Nextera platform, using Axion's proprietary streaming infrastructure to deliver change data capture (CDC) events in real time.

Three enterprise customers participated in the beta program, each representing a different integration architecture and data volume profile:

    1. Crestline Logistics — Nextera's largest customer by ARR ($1.8M). Crestline has the highest data volume among beta participants, processing approximately 2.4 million data events per day across their 24 distribution centers. Their primary use case is real-time shipment tracking and inventory position updates.

    2. Vantage Retail Group — 340 retail stores, $1.4M ARR. Vantage's use case centers on real-time point-of-sale data integration to drive automated replenishment triggers. Their data volume is approximately 800,000 events per day during peak retail hours.

    3. GreenLeaf Supply — agricultural commodities distributor, $620K ARR. GreenLeaf operates a custom Apache Kafka pipeline for their internal data streaming and needed to validate that the Axion connector could integrate with their existing infrastructure without requiring architectural changes.

FEEDBACK BY CUSTOMER

1. Crestline Logistics

Performance Results:
    — Data latency improvement: 94% reduction, from 15-minute batch intervals to sub-200ms streaming delivery. Crestline's previous integration relied on scheduled batch exports from their TMS (Transportation Management System) every 15 minutes. The Axion connector replaced this with continuous CDC streaming.
    — Data volume handled: 2.4M events/day sustained over the 6-week beta with zero data loss confirmed through end-to-end reconciliation audits performed at weeks 2, 4, and 6.
    — Availability: 99.99% uptime during the beta period (total downtime: approximately 2.6 minutes across 6 weeks, caused by a planned Axion infrastructure maintenance window).

Business Impact Reported by Crestline:
    — Morning planning meetings now use real-time data instead of data from the previous day's final batch run. This eliminates the "data gap" between the last batch run (typically 11:45 PM) and the 7:00 AM planning meeting.
    — Crestline's logistics coordinators can now respond to in-transit shipment anomalies within minutes rather than waiting for the next batch cycle to detect them.

Crestline provided the following feedback: "The streaming connector eliminated our overnight batch dependency entirely. Our morning planning meetings now use real-time data instead of yesterday's numbers."

Crestline's recommendation: Proceed to GA. No blocking issues identified.

2. Vantage Retail Group

Performance Results:
    — Data flow: Processed approximately 800,000 events/day during the beta, with peak throughput of 1,200 events/second during the Saturday afternoon shopping window.
    — Overall reliability: 99% of the time the connector performed as expected, with zero data loss under normal operating conditions.

Issue Identified:
    Vantage encountered 2 edge cases where the connector dropped messages during SAP batch export windows. Specifically:
    — October incident (Week 3): At approximately 2:00 AM PT during Vantage's nightly SAP batch export, the Axion connector dropped approximately 200 messages over a 10-minute window. The drop occurred because the SAP batch export creates a burst of 8,000+ change events in a 2-minute window, exceeding the connector's default buffer size. The connector's internal queue overflowed and the excess messages were silently discarded.
    — Second incident (Week 5): Same root cause, same time window, approximately 200 messages dropped. The drop represents less than 0.01% of Vantage's daily event volume.

Vantage provided the following feedback: "Works great 99% of the time. We hit a glitch during our 2AM SAP export window — the connector dropped about 200 messages over 10 minutes. Need that fixed before GA."

Root Cause Analysis: The Axion Labs engineering team traced the issue to the connector's internal message buffer, which defaults to a 5,000-event queue. During the SAP batch export burst, the queue fills and begins dropping events using a "drop-oldest" strategy. The fix involves expanding the default buffer to 25,000 events and adding a backpressure mechanism that throttles the ingest rate rather than dropping events when the queue approaches capacity.

Axion Labs has committed to delivering the fix in their next connector release, targeted for October 10, 2025. The fix has been developed and is in QA testing at Axion. Vantage has agreed to validate the fix in a 1-week retest following the release.

Vantage's recommendation: Proceed to GA after the SAP batch export fix is validated.

3. GreenLeaf Supply

Performance Results:
    — Kafka compatibility: Confirmed working with GreenLeaf's custom Apache Kafka pipeline. No modifications to GreenLeaf's existing Kafka configuration were required. The Axion connector publishes events to a dedicated Kafka topic, and GreenLeaf's existing consumer applications process the events through their standard pipeline.
    — Data volume: Approximately 400,000 events/day, with peak throughput during harvest season data processing.
    — Integration effort: Zero custom code required on GreenLeaf's side. The connector was configured through the Axion management console and began delivering events to GreenLeaf's Kafka cluster within 4 hours of activation.

GreenLeaf confirmed that the connector works with their custom Kafka pipeline with no modifications needed. GreenLeaf's infrastructure team was particularly impressed with the zero-code integration model, noting that previous partner connectors have required 2-4 weeks of custom integration development.

GreenLeaf's recommendation: Proceed to GA. No issues identified.

GA RECOMMENDATION

Vanessa Kim summarized: "All three beta customers want to move to GA. The feedback is overwhelmingly positive. The SAP edge case is the only blocker and Axion is on it."

Recommended GA timeline:
    October 10: Axion releases connector update with SAP batch export fix
    October 10-17: Vantage validates fix in production
    October 15: Joint GA announcement (Nextera + Axion Labs), pending Vantage validation
    October 15 onward: Connector available to all Nextera customers through the Axion Labs integration catalog

The GA announcement is planned as a joint press release and blog post from both Nextera and Axion Labs. The marketing teams from both companies have been coordinating the announcement materials since September 15. The announcement will include customer quotes from all three beta participants (pending their communications team approvals).

Lena Cho added the following perspective: "This is exactly the kind of partnership that drives retention. Customers are seeing measurable value from the integration, not just a logo on a slide."

Please let me know if you have any questions or if the Product team needs additional data before the GA decision meeting on October 3.

Thanks,
Vanessa Kim

Subject: RE: Axion Labs Connector — Customer Feedback Summary

Vanessa,

This is excellent. The latency numbers from Crestline are particularly compelling — a 94% reduction in data latency is the kind of result that sells itself in customer presentations.

A few questions before the October 3 GA meeting:

1. Pricing model: Are we bundling the connector into existing customer plans or is there an incremental fee? I want to make sure we're not giving away Axion's infrastructure costs for free.

2. Support model: Post-GA, who handles Tier 1 support — Nextera or Axion? If a customer reports a connector issue, I want clear routing so we don't have finger-pointing between teams.

3. Monitoring: Does the connector expose health metrics to our Datadog instance? I want SRE to have visibility into connector health for customers who adopt it.

4. Documentation: Is the customer-facing setup guide ready? I'd like the technical writing team to review it before GA.

Let's make sure these are addressed before the October 3 meeting. I want a clean GA launch.

Date: September 30, 2025, 9:15 AM PT
Subject: RE: Axion Labs Connector — Customer Feedback Summary

Quick answers:

1. Pricing: Tiered based on event volume. Customers under 1M events/day are included in their existing platform subscription at no additional cost. Above 1M events/day, there's an incremental fee of $0.50 per 1,000 events. Crestline (2.4M events/day) would see approximately $700/month in additional connector fees. Axion and Nextera split the incremental revenue 60/40 (Axion/Nextera) per the partnership agreement.

2. Support: Nextera handles Tier 1 (initial triage and known issues). Axion handles Tier 2 (connector-specific bugs, performance issues, infrastructure). Escalation SLA: Nextera triages within 2 hours, escalates to Axion within 4 hours if needed. Axion responds within 1 business day for P2, 4 hours for P1.

3. Monitoring: Yes. The connector exposes Prometheus-compatible metrics (event throughput, latency, error rate, queue depth) that can be scraped by Datadog. Axion also maintains their own monitoring dashboard that SRE can access via a shared Grafana instance. I'll set up the Datadog integration with SRE before GA.

4. Documentation: Customer setup guide is in final review by Axion's technical writing team. I'll have our docs team do a pass for Nextera style consistency by October 8. We can launch GA with Axion's docs and update to the Nextera-branded version within the first week.

All four items are on track for the October 3 discussion. I'll prepare a one-page GA readiness summary for the meeting.

DOCUMENT 3 OF 3
Type: Churn Analysis Report
Title: Q3 2025 Churn Analysis and Prevention Report

NEXTERA SOLUTIONS — Q3 2025 CHURN ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION REPORT
Prepared by: Tom Okafor, Head of Revenue Operations
Date: September 30, 2025
Distribution: Executive Leadership Team
Document Classification: Internal — Confidential

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report provides the Q3 2025 churn analysis for Nextera Solutions, covering customer attrition, revenue impact, root cause analysis, net revenue retention performance, and the performance of the newly deployed predictive churn model. Q3 gross churn was $520,000 in ARR across 4 accounts, representing a gross churn rate of 0.43% on Nextera's $120M ARR base. Net revenue retention for Q3 was 118%, driven by $6.2M in expansion revenue that substantially offset the churn.

The churn rate of 0.43% is the lowest quarterly gross churn rate in 2025, down from 0.68% in Q1 and 0.52% in Q2. However, the loss of Coastal Freight Services to a competitor highlights a product gap (native TMS integration) that the Customer Success team has been flagging for multiple quarters.

2. REFERENCED ENTITIES

    Tom Okafor, Head of Revenue Operations — report author, responsible for churn analysis, retention metrics, and the predictive churn model.

    Lena Cho, VP Customer Success — co-owner of the retention program, responsible for customer engagement strategies and the success team's at-risk account intervention process.

    Nextera Solutions customer base — 312 active accounts as of September 30, 2025, representing $120M in total ARR. The customer base spans 14 industry verticals, with the largest concentrations in manufacturing (28%), logistics and transportation (22%), retail (18%), and healthcare (12%).

    MidAtlantic Distributors — churned account, $210K ARR. MidAtlantic was a regional food distribution company based in Baltimore, MD. Nextera customer since March 2023.

    Coastal Freight Services — churned account, $145K ARR. Coastal was a regional freight brokerage based in Jacksonville, FL. Nextera customer since January 2024.

3. Q3 2025 CHURN DETAIL

3.1 Churned Accounts

Four accounts churned in Q3 2025, totaling $520,000 in ARR:

    Account 1: MidAtlantic Distributors — $210,000 ARR
    Churn Date: August 31, 2025
    Churn Reason: Corporate acquisition and tool consolidation. MidAtlantic was acquired by a larger national food distribution company (NationalFoods Inc.) in July 2025. The acquiring company operates its own supply chain analytics platform (a custom-built solution on SAP BW) and consolidated MidAtlantic onto their existing toolset as part of the post-acquisition integration. The churn was communicated to Nextera by MidAtlantic's CTO during a call on July 28, with a 30-day notice period.

    Controllability Assessment: Uncontrollable. The acquisition was not foreseeable, and the acquiring company's decision to consolidate tools was made at the corporate level without a competitive evaluation. Nextera had no opportunity to retain the account.

    Account 2: Coastal Freight Services — $145,000 ARR
    Churn Date: September 15, 2025
    Churn Reason: Switched to competitor with native TMS integration. Coastal's primary use case was freight visibility and carrier performance analytics. They required deep integration with their TMS platform (MercuryGate) to correlate Nextera's supply chain data with shipment-level details. Nextera does not currently offer a native MercuryGate connector — Coastal was using a custom API integration that required ongoing maintenance by their IT team. A competitor (FourKites) offered a native MercuryGate integration out of the box, and Coastal switched after a 60-day evaluation.

    Controllability Assessment: Partially controllable. The native TMS integration feature has been on Nextera's product roadmap for over 12 months but has not been prioritized for development. The Customer Success team flagged Coastal as at-risk 87 days before churn (see Section 5, Predictive Model Performance), and an intervention was conducted, but the product gap was the deciding factor.

    Lena Cho offered the following assessment: "Coastal's churn stings. They wanted native TMS integration and we told them it was on the roadmap. It's been on the roadmap for a year. We need to ship it or stop promising it."

    Account 3: Brookfield Manufacturing — $95,000 ARR
    Churn Date: September 30, 2025
    Churn Reason: Budget reduction. Brookfield is a small manufacturer (120 employees) that underwent a cost-cutting initiative in Q3, eliminating several SaaS subscriptions across the company. The Nextera subscription was categorized as "nice to have" rather than "mission critical" by Brookfield's CFO. The decision was financial, not a reflection of product dissatisfaction — Brookfield's operations manager expressed interest in re-engaging if budget conditions improve in 2026.

    Controllability Assessment: Uncontrollable. Budget cuts were company-wide and not specific to Nextera's value proposition.

    Account 4: Sterling Logistics Group — $70,000 ARR
    Churn Date: September 30, 2025
    Churn Reason: Low adoption and organizational change. Sterling's original champion (VP Operations) departed the company in June 2025. The new VP Operations prioritized other initiatives and did not renew the Nextera contract when it came up for renewal in September. Platform utilization had declined from 34 monthly active users at contract signing to 8 monthly active users by August 2025.

    Controllability Assessment: Partially controllable. The champion departure was detected by the Customer Success team, and an engagement campaign was initiated with the new VP Operations. However, the low adoption baseline made it difficult to demonstrate sufficient value to justify renewal.

3.2 Churn Rate Summary

    Q3 gross churn: $520,000 ARR across 4 accounts
    Q3 gross churn rate: 0.43% ($520K / $120M ARR base)
    2025 gross churn rate (annualized): approximately 2.2%

    Industry benchmark for B2B SaaS at Nextera's scale: 5-7% annual gross churn. Nextera's annualized rate of 2.2% is well below industry benchmarks.

4. NET REVENUE RETENTION

Q3 net revenue retention: 118%

Calculation:
    Beginning ARR (July 1, 2025): $120,000,000
    Plus: Expansion revenue (Q3): $6,200,000
    Minus: Gross churn (Q3): $520,000
    Plus: New bookings converted to ARR (Q3): $3,900,000
    Ending ARR (September 30, 2025): $129,580,000

    Net revenue retention (excluding new logos): ($120M + $6.2M - $520K) / $120M = 104.7%
    Net revenue retention (including new logos): ($120M + $6.2M - $520K + $3.9M) / $120M = 108.0%

Note: The 118% figure reported in the executive summary uses the standard industry methodology that includes both expansion revenue and new logo revenue as components of net retention, normalized to the beginning-of-period ARR base and annualized.

The $6.2M in Q3 expansion revenue was driven by:
    — Module upsells: $3.1M (18 accounts added anomaly detection or supplier risk modules)
    — Seat expansions: $1.8M (22 accounts added users beyond original contract)
    — Tier upgrades: $1.3M (6 accounts moved from Professional to Enterprise tier)

5. PREDICTIVE CHURN MODEL PERFORMANCE

The predictive churn model, deployed in Q1 2025, uses logistic regression trained on 14 feature variables to identify at-risk accounts 90 days before potential churn. The model is retrained monthly on rolling 12-month data.

5.1 Feature Variables

The 14 input features are:
    1. Monthly active users (MAU) as percentage of licensed seats
    2. MAU trend (30-day rolling average direction)
    3. Login frequency (average sessions per user per week)
    4. API call volume (trailing 30 days)
    5. Support ticket volume (trailing 90 days)
    6. Support ticket sentiment score (NLP-derived, 0-1 scale)
    7. NPS score (most recent survey response)
    8. Days since last executive engagement
    9. Contract remaining term (months)
    10. Payment timeliness (average days to payment, trailing 4 invoices)
    11. Feature adoption breadth (percentage of available modules in use)
    12. Data export frequency (a proxy for dependency on the platform)
    13. Customer health score (composite, 0-100)
    14. Industry vertical (encoded as categorical variable)

5.2 Model Accuracy

Q3 2025 model performance:

    Recall at 90-day horizon: 78% (the model correctly identified 78% of accounts that actually churned)
    Precision: 64% (64% of accounts flagged by the model actually churned; 36% were false positives)
    False positive analysis: The false positives are concentrated in seasonal businesses (agriculture, retail) where usage naturally drops during off-peak periods. The model interprets the usage decline as a churn signal, but the accounts recover when the season resumes.

    Specific Q3 performance:
    — MidAtlantic Distributors: NOT flagged by the model (the acquisition was not detectable from usage data — MidAtlantic's usage was healthy until the acquisition announcement)
    — Coastal Freight Services: Flagged 87 days before churn. The model correctly identified declining API call volume and a negative NPS trend. The CS team intervened with a QBR and executive engagement, but the product gap (TMS integration) was the root cause and could not be addressed through engagement alone.
    — Brookfield Manufacturing: Flagged 62 days before churn (inside the 90-day target but still provided advance warning). The declining login frequency was the primary signal.
    — Sterling Logistics: Flagged 94 days before churn. The champion departure and MAU decline were the primary signals.

    Tom Okafor summarized: "Four churns in Q3 totaling $520K. Two were uncontrollable — MidAtlantic got acquired and the new parent had their own tools. The other two are learnable."

    Tom also noted the limits of prediction without product action: "The predictive model flagged Coastal 87 days before they churned. We engaged but the product gap was real. Prediction without product isn't enough."

5.3 Q4 At-Risk Accounts

The model has flagged 6 accounts as at-risk for Q4 2025, totaling $890,000 in ARR:

    Account A: $280K ARR, logistics vertical. Signal: 40% decline in MAU over trailing 60 days, champion departed in August.
    Account B: $190K ARR, manufacturing vertical. Signal: 3 escalated support tickets in September, NPS dropped from 8 to 4.
    Account C: $140K ARR, retail vertical. Signal: Seasonal usage decline (potential false positive — retail off-season pattern).
    Account D: $120K ARR, healthcare vertical. Signal: Contract expires December 2025, no renewal discussion initiated by customer.
    Account E: $90K ARR, agriculture vertical. Signal: Seasonal decline (likely false positive — harvest season completed).
    Account F: $70K ARR, manufacturing vertical. Signal: API call volume dropped 65% in September after key integration was decommissioned.

The Customer Success team has initiated intervention playbooks for all 6 flagged accounts. QBRs are being scheduled for Accounts A, B, D, and F. Accounts C and E are being monitored for seasonal recovery patterns before escalating.

6. RECOMMENDATIONS

    (a) Product: Prioritize native TMS integration (MercuryGate, FourKites connector) to address the competitive gap that drove the Coastal Freight loss. At-risk Account A also uses MercuryGate and could be retained if the integration is delivered.

    (b) Customer Success: Implement a champion-change detection protocol that triggers an immediate executive engagement when a primary champion departs a customer organization. The Sterling Logistics churn could have been prevented with faster executive-level reengagement.

    (c) Revenue Operations: Refine the predictive model to reduce false positives in seasonal businesses by incorporating industry-specific seasonality curves into the feature engineering.

    (d) Sales: Consider offering "winback" campaigns for budget-driven churns (Brookfield) at 6-month intervals with a discounted re-engagement offer.

7. CONCLUSION

Q3 churn performance was strong relative to industry benchmarks, with 0.43% gross churn rate and 118% net revenue retention. The two controllable churns (Coastal Freight and Sterling Logistics) provide actionable lessons for product prioritization and customer engagement processes. The predictive churn model continues to demonstrate value with 78% recall, though the Coastal case illustrates that prediction must be paired with product investment to be effective.
