Subject: Long-Term Prepaid Contract Write-Down Analysis

Priya, Jordan,

Per the new vendor contract guidance, I've identified $4.2M in prepaid commitments with remaining terms exceeding 18 months.

Following the vendor contract policy update on January 30, I've completed a comprehensive analysis of our prepaid vendor commitments. This memo summarizes the findings and presents a recommendation for accelerated amortization to bring our prepaid balance in line with the new 18-month maximum term policy.

I. PREPAID COMMITMENTS OVER 18 MONTHS

Seven vendor contracts currently have prepaid balances with remaining terms exceeding 18 months:

1. Snowflake (Data Warehouse)
   - Original term: 36 months (signed January 2024)
   - Original prepaid amount: $6.3M ($2.1M/year x 3 years)
   - Remaining prepaid balance: $4.2M (24 months remaining as of Feb 1, 2025)
   - Monthly amortization (current): $175K
   - STATUS: Renewal restructured from 36 months to 12 months per new policy (see below)

   Jordan: "Snowflake renewal is done — restructured from 36 months to 12 months. We gave up the 12% volume discount to get the shorter term. Net cost increase: $180K/year."

   Vasquez: "Approved. The flexibility is worth the cost increase. Process all other renewals under the same framework."

2. Datadog (Monitoring)
   - Original term: 36 months (signed December 2024)
   - Original prepaid amount: $1.53M ($0.51M/year x 3 years, post-discount)
   - Remaining prepaid balance: $1.44M (34 months remaining)
   - Monthly amortization (current): $42.5K
   - Contract ID: VND-2024-0147
   - Primary use case: application performance monitoring, infrastructure monitoring, log management
   - Monthly usage: 2.4M host-hours, 18TB log ingestion
   - STATUS: Restructured from 36 months to 18 months. Retained partial discount (8% vs original 15%). Additional cost: $42K/year.
   - Restructuring note: Datadog account team initially resisted the shorter term. After two weeks of negotiation, they agreed to 18 months with a partial discount. The original 36-month term included a 15% volume discount; the restructured 18-month term retains an 8% discount, representing a 7-percentage-point concession. The incremental annual cost of $42K reflects this reduced discount applied to the full contract value.

3. MongoDB Atlas (Database)
   - Original term: 24 months (signed March 2024)
   - Prepaid balance: $480K (12 months remaining)
   - Monthly amortization: $20K
   - Contract ID: VND-2024-0089
   - Primary use case: primary application database, analytics data store
   - Cluster configuration: M80 dedicated cluster, 3 shards, cross-region replication
   - Monthly throughput: 12.8M read operations, 4.2M write operations
   - STATUS: Under 18 months remaining — no action needed. Next renewal will be 12-month term.

4. Confluent (Kafka Managed Service)
   - Original term: 24 months (signed February 2024)
   - Prepaid balance: $360K (12 months remaining)
   - Monthly amortization: $15K
   - Contract ID: VND-2024-0072
   - Primary use case: event streaming, data pipeline backbone, real-time analytics
   - Monthly throughput: 850M messages, 4.2TB data processed
   - STATUS: Under 18 months remaining — no action needed. Next renewal will be 12-month term.

5. LaunchDarkly (Feature Flags)
   - Original term: 24 months (signed February 2024)
   - Prepaid balance: $192K (12 months remaining)
   - Monthly amortization: $8K
   - Contract ID: VND-2024-0068
   - Primary use case: feature flag management, progressive rollouts, A/B testing
   - Active flags: 347 (up from 212 at contract signing)
   - STATUS: Under 18 months remaining — no action needed.

6. Segment (Customer Data Platform)
   - Original term: 24 months (signed February 2024)
   - Prepaid balance: $312K (12 months remaining)
   - Monthly amortization: $13K
   - Contract ID: VND-2024-0071
   - Primary use case: customer data collection, identity resolution, audience segmentation
   - Monthly tracked users: 2.1M (up from 1.4M at signing)
   - STATUS: Under 18 months remaining — no action needed.

7. HashiCorp (Infrastructure Automation)
   - Original term: 24 months (signed September 2024)
   - Prepaid balance: $168K (19 months remaining)
   - Monthly amortization: $8.4K
   - Contract ID: VND-2024-0138
   - Primary use case: Terraform Cloud, Vault secrets management, Consul service mesh
   - Active workspaces: 89, secrets managed: 1,240
   - STATUS: 1 month over 18-month threshold. Will amortize down to 18 months by March. No restructuring needed — natural runoff brings this into compliance.

Total prepaid contracts over 18 months: 7 vendors, $4.2M total (but only $1.44M + $168K = $1.61M actually exceeds 18-month remaining terms)

Summary of prepaid vendor commitments:

| Vendor         | Contract ID     | Original Term | Remaining Term | Prepaid Balance | Monthly Amort | Status              |
|----------------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|-----------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Snowflake      | VND-2024-0041   | 36 months     | 24 months      | $4.2M           | $175K         | Restructured to 12m |
| Datadog        | VND-2024-0147   | 36 months     | 34 months      | $1.44M          | $42.5K        | Restructured to 18m |
| MongoDB Atlas  | VND-2024-0089   | 24 months     | 12 months      | $480K           | $20K          | Compliant            |
| Confluent      | VND-2024-0072   | 24 months     | 12 months      | $360K           | $15K          | Compliant            |
| LaunchDarkly   | VND-2024-0068   | 24 months     | 12 months      | $192K           | $8K           | Compliant            |
| Segment        | VND-2024-0071   | 24 months     | 12 months      | $312K           | $13K          | Compliant            |
| HashiCorp      | VND-2024-0138   | 24 months     | 19 months      | $168K           | $8.4K         | Runoff by March      |

Total aggregate prepaid balance across these 7 vendors: $7.152M
Total monthly amortization: $281.9K
Contracts requiring active restructuring: 2 (Snowflake, Datadog)
Contracts naturally compliant: 4 (MongoDB, Confluent, LaunchDarkly, Segment)
Contracts in natural runoff: 1 (HashiCorp)

II. ACCELERATED AMORTIZATION RECOMMENDATION

I recommend accelerated amortization to bring these balances down by end of Q2. The impact to operating expense is approximately $1.8M spread over Q1 and Q2.

Accelerated amortization schedule:

Q1 2025 (January-March): $900K additional amortization expense
- Snowflake: $500K (accelerate 2.9 months of expense into Q1)
- Datadog: $280K (accelerate portion of 36-month to 18-month restructure)
- Other contracts: $120K (minor adjustments)

Q2 2025 (April-June): $900K additional amortization expense
- Snowflake: $600K (complete write-down to 12-month remaining term)
- Datadog: $200K (complete restructure amortization)
- Other contracts: $100K (minor adjustments)

Total incremental operating expense impact: $1.8M over Q1-Q2

III. IMPACT ON FINANCIAL METRICS

The accelerated amortization will affect the following metrics:

EBITDA impact:
- Q1 2025 EBITDA: -$900K incremental expense (reduces Q1 EBITDA by $900K)
- Q2 2025 EBITDA: -$900K incremental expense
- Net annual impact: $1.8M additional opex in FY2025 (one-time catch-up)

Cash flow impact:
- No cash impact — the cash was already spent when the prepaid contracts were signed
- Accelerated amortization is a non-cash expense adjustment

Balance sheet impact:
- Prepaid assets decrease by $1.8M over H1 2025
- Retained earnings decrease by $1.8M (net of tax)

Cash position impact:
- Q1 ending cash projection revised from $25.1M to $24.2M (due to the operating expense impact on EBITDA, not the amortization itself — the EBITDA decline reflects higher reported opex which affects investor/board metrics)
- Correction: cash is not affected by non-cash amortization. Q1 ending cash is affected by the actual cost increases from restructuring vendors to shorter terms.

Actual cash impact from vendor restructuring:
- Snowflake shorter term (lost discount): $180K/year = $45K in Q1
- Datadog shorter term (reduced discount): $42K/year = $10.5K in Q1
- Total Q1 cash impact from restructuring: $55.5K

IV. COMPLIANCE STATUS

New policy compliance: 89% of renewals now under 18 months.

Summary of vendor contract restructuring progress:
- Snowflake: restructured to 12 months (completed)
- Datadog: restructured to 18 months (completed)
- MongoDB: renewing at 12 months in March (in process)
- Confluent: renewing at 12 months in February (in process)
- All new vendor contracts: defaulting to 12-month terms per policy
- Remaining prepaids to restructure: 5 contracts in negotiation

Contracts still exceeding 18-month term:
- AWS: 3-year term (grandfathered, not subject to new policy)
- HashiCorp: 19 months remaining (will be under 18 months by March)

V. BOARD REPORTING

I recommend including the following in the February board package:

1. Summary of vendor contract policy change and rationale
2. Accelerated amortization impact ($1.8M over Q1-Q2)
3. Updated Q1 EBITDA guidance reflecting the additional expense
4. Note that cash position is minimally impacted ($55.5K in Q1)

The board should understand that this is a one-time catch-up expense, not a recurring increase. After H1 2025, operating expenses will normalize because vendor commitments will be on shorter terms with lower (but more frequent) amortization.

Angela,

Approved. The flexibility is worth the cost increase. Process all other renewals under the same framework.

Good analysis. A few comments:

1. The $1.8M accelerated amortization is significant but manageable. Our Q1 revenue is tracking 5-7% above plan, which offsets the incremental expense. Include this in the board package with the context that it's a one-time adjustment.

2. On the Snowflake restructuring — losing the 12% discount is unfortunate but the shorter term is more important right now. We can revisit volume pricing when the next renewal comes up.

3. For the remaining 5 contracts in negotiation, push hard for 12-month terms. If vendors push back, 18 months is acceptable. Nothing over 18 months without my explicit approval. Have Jordan track each negotiation individually and report weekly until all five are resolved.

4. Good catch on the cash vs. non-cash distinction. Please make sure the board package clearly separates the amortization impact (non-cash, P&L only) from the actual cash impact of shorter terms (modest, $55.5K in Q1). I want two separate line items in the board presentation: one for the accounting adjustment and one for the real cash cost of shorter terms. The board needs to understand these are fundamentally different impacts.

5. Add to your analysis: what is the total "vendor flexibility premium" — i.e., how much more per year does it cost us to have shorter vendor commitments across the board? I want to quantify the cost of flexibility so the board can make an informed assessment.

Subject: RE: Long-Term Prepaid Contract Write-Down Analysis

Priya,

On item 5 — preliminary estimate of the annual "vendor flexibility premium":

Total annual cost increase from moving all vendors to sub-18-month terms:
- Snowflake: +$180K/year (12% discount lost)
- Datadog: +$42K/year (partial discount reduction)
- MongoDB: +$12K/year (estimated, negotiation pending)
- Confluent: +$10.8K/year (estimated)
- LaunchDarkly: +$9.6K/year (estimated)
- Other smaller vendors: +$40K/year (estimated across 8 contracts)
- Total vendor flexibility premium: approximately $294K/year

For context, $294K/year is:
- 0.27% of FY2025 operating budget ($108.6M)
- 2.0% of total annual vendor spend ($14.8M)
- Equivalent to roughly 1.5 engineer-equivalents in cost

I'll include this analysis in the board package with the framing that $294K/year buys significant flexibility across 142 vendor relationships.

One additional data point: I surveyed the vendor management team and approximately 60% of our vendor partners have been cooperative with the shorter-term requests. The remaining 40% required some level of negotiation, typically involving partial discount concessions. No vendor has refused to restructure outright, though three vendors (PagerDuty, Splunk, and CircleCI) are still in active negotiation as of today.

Vendor restructuring timeline:
- PagerDuty: negotiation started Feb 3, expected resolution by Feb 21
- Splunk: negotiation started Feb 5, expected resolution by Feb 24
- CircleCI: negotiation started Feb 10, expected resolution by Feb 28
- Two additional contracts (Notion, Figma) are up for renewal in March and will be renewed at 12-month terms per new policy

:mega: Rec engine v3 customer milestone update!

3 days since launch and the adoption numbers are incredible:
- 89 customers activated (up from 47 at launch)
- That's 41% of our customer base
- Customer satisfaction score for v3: 4.7 / 5.0 (based on 62 survey responses)
- Support tickets related to v3: 12 (all P3/P4 cosmetic issues)
- Zero P1 or P2 issues reported by any customer

Quick breakdown of activations by segment:
- Enterprise: 42 of 84 (50% activation rate)
- Mid-Market: 36 of 96 (37.5% activation rate)
- Emerging: 11 of 41 (26.8% activation rate)

Freight Corp's CTO emailed to say rec engine v3 "exceeded all expectations." Direct quote: "This is the kind of innovation that keeps us loyal to Nextera."

DB Schenker's analytics team reported a 35% improvement in route optimization accuracy for their European distribution network using v3. That's even better than the 23% improvement we measured internally. Their head of logistics analytics sent a detailed write-up comparing v2 vs v3 performance across 14 European distribution centers. Route accuracy improved in every single center, with the biggest gains in their Nordic network (42% improvement).

Maersk's initial feedback: "The real-time recommendation capability is transforming how we plan our ocean freight operations. We're already seeing cost savings from route optimization." Their VP of Digital Freight shared preliminary estimates of $2.8M in annual cost avoidance from route optimization alone.

LogiFlow activated v3 on day 2 and their operations team reported a 28% reduction in empty container repositioning costs. Their account manager said this cements their expansion commitment.

The early customer response validates everything the engineering team built. This is a category-defining release.

Support ticket breakdown for v3:
- P3 (cosmetic): 8 tickets (UI rendering on Safari, timezone formatting, pagination edge case)
- P4 (enhancement requests): 4 tickets (additional export formats, bulk recommendation API, dashboard customization)
- P1/P2: 0 tickets
- Average ticket resolution time: 2.4 hours (vs. 4.1 hours company average)

[10:09 AM] marcus.webb
Music to my ears. The engineering team put 8 months of intense work into this release. Hearing these customer reactions makes it all worth it. :heart:

Quick update from my side:
- February uptime: 99.99%. That's 43 seconds of downtime in 17 days. Incredible work @platform-team :fire:
- The K8s migration cost savings are tracking: February compute costs are $208K vs. $355K in January (pre-migration). That's a 41% reduction, consistent with our 42% estimate.

[10:13 AM] ben.arujo
Axion integration: 85% of API endpoints now integrated. On track for internal demo Feb 28.

Integration progress as of February 17:

- All remaining endpoints will be complete by February 21
- Full pipeline load testing begins February 24
- Internal demo February 28 at 10 AM (calendar invite going out today)

Data pipeline metrics:
- Processing 2.8M events/day in staging (up from 2M last week — more data sources coming online)
- End-to-end latency: 2.1 seconds (improved from 3.0 seconds through Kafka consumer optimization)
- Data quality: 99.8% schema compliance
- Events by source: maritime tracking (1.2M/day), road freight (0.9M/day), warehouse telemetry (0.5M/day), weather (0.2M/day)
- Schema validation: all 47 event types pass validation; zero schema drift detected this sprint

Detailed endpoint status:
- Completed: real-time lane pricing (v1.2), route optimization (v1.1), container tracking (v1.0), port congestion index (v1.0), demand forecasting (v1.0), carrier rating (v1.0), shipment ETA (v1.0), capacity planning (v1.0), fuel cost optimization (v1.0), inventory positioning (v1.0), cross-dock scheduling (v1.0), customs clearance (v1.0), warehouse allocation (v1.0), fleet analytics (v1.0), trade lane analytics (v1.0)
- In progress: batch historical data retrieval — shipment (80% complete), batch historical data retrieval — lane (60% complete), webhook management (50% complete)

[10:15 AM] diana.marsh
Great work @ben.arujo. The customer advisory board is asking about the beta timeline. Can you confirm we're still targeting June?

[10:16 AM] ben.arujo
@diana.marsh Yes, June is still the target for customer beta. March internal demo, April internal testing with synthetic data, May closed beta with 5 design partners, June open beta. No changes to the timeline.

[10:18 AM] hannah.choi
The customer advisory board feedback from last week was very positive. 8 of 10 members said they would upgrade their plan for access to the Axion logistics data. That's strong signal for the pricing team.

[10:17 AM] raj.patel
v3 performance in production: 25% improvement in query latency vs v2. At peak traffic yesterday (890 QPS), p99 was 215ms. This is the fastest we've ever been.

For the data nerds, here are the production performance metrics after 3 days:
- Throughput: sustained 890 QPS peak (capacity: 1,150 QPS)
- p50 latency: 78ms (v2 was 120ms)
- p99 latency: 215ms (v2 was 380ms)
- Error rate: 0.002%
- Cache hit rate: 87% (up from 72% in v2 — the new caching layer is working well)

[10:21 AM] lisa.chen
Platform team update: all three AWS regions are fully running K8s 1.29. DR migration completed ahead of schedule. Total migration duration across all regions: 26 days, zero customer impact.

Infrastructure savings update:
- January compute cost (pre-K8s): $355K
- February compute cost (post-K8s, pro-rated): $208K
- Projected annual savings: $1.76M (slightly above our $1.68M estimate)

The Kubernetes auto-scaler handled the v3 launch traffic spike beautifully. We scaled from 45 pods to 78 pods during peak launch hour, then scaled back down to 50 pods within 2 hours. In the old EC2 architecture, we would have had to pre-provision 30+ additional instances for launch day.

[10:25 AM] carlos.rivera
As someone who worked on both the hackathon project and the v3 launch, I just want to say: this is the most exciting time to be an engineer at Nextera. The tech stack is modern, the products are genuinely impactful, and the team culture is :fire:

[10:27 AM] elena.vasquez
The K8s migration cost savings are real. My team was spending 30% of our sprint capacity on EC2 instance management before the migration. Now we're spending about 8% on K8s operations and the rest goes to actual feature work. Huge quality-of-life improvement for the platform team.

[10:28 AM] sami.okoro
+1. And the hackathon winning project (ChainWhisperer) is now in product evaluation. If it ships, it'll be the first hackathon project to become a real product feature since the anomaly detection module last year.

For those who missed the demo: ChainWhisperer is an NLP-powered supply chain anomaly detector. It processes natural language shipping notes and identifies potential disruption signals 6-8 hours before they show up in structured data. During the hackathon, it correctly predicted 3 out of 4 port congestion events in the historical data set.

[10:31 AM] tomas.lindgren
From CS: the v3 adoption rate of 41% in 3 days is the fastest feature adoption we've ever seen. For comparison, rec engine v2 took 3 weeks to reach 34% adoption. The product is genuinely resonating with customers.

Adoption velocity comparison:
- v3: 41% in 3 days (89 customers)
- v2: 34% in 21 days, reached 41% in 28 days
- Dashboard redesign (last major release): 22% in 7 days
- Anomaly detection module: 18% in 14 days

Customer health impact: 4 accounts moved from "yellow" to "green" health status in the past week, all citing v3 as the primary reason.

[10:34 AM] hannah.choi
Thank you all for the updates. The product momentum right now is incredible. Between v3 adoption, the Axion integration progress, and the dashboard redesign on track for March, we're in the strongest product position in the company's history.

Q1 product delivery scorecard:
- Rec engine v3: SHIPPED (February 14, on schedule)
- Axion integration: ON TRACK (demo Feb 28, beta June)
- Supply chain dashboard redesign: ON TRACK (GA March, currently in final QA)
- Mobile app v2: ON TRACK (beta April)
- ChainWhisperer evaluation: IN PROGRESS (product review March 10)

[10:37 AM] kevin.orosco
The sales team is loving the v3 customer reactions. We've already cited Freight Corp and DB Schenker feedback in 6 active proposals. Nothing sells like happy customers talking about results.

Pipeline update: three new enterprise opportunities entered the pipeline this week, all sourced from v3 launch publicity. Combined potential ACV: $680K.

NEXTERA SOLUTIONS, INC.
FEBRUARY 2025 MID-MONTH FINANCIAL FLASH

Prepared By: Derek Hollis, FP&A Manager
Date: February 17, 2025

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

February flash: revenue tracking $10.8M against $10.2M plan. Bookings at $3.1M MTD, on pace for $5.5M.

I. REVENUE

February revenue (MTD, 17 days): $10.8M
February plan: $10.2M
Variance: +$0.6M (+5.9%)

Revenue is tracking 6% above plan for the month. The outperformance is driven by:
1. Rec engine v3 launch driving higher platform usage (usage-based revenue component)
2. DB Schenker expansion ($420K ACV) beginning to recognize in February
3. Strong renewal activity — 4 enterprise renewals closed above prior ACV

Monthly revenue trend (last 6 months):
- September 2024: $9.6M
- October 2024: $10.7M
- November 2024: $10.4M
- December 2024: $10.1M
- January 2025: $10.4M
- February 2025 (projected): $10.8M

II. BOOKINGS

February bookings MTD: $3.1M
February projected: $5.5M
Q1 bookings YTD: $9.3M (of $36.8M annual quota)

Notable February deals:
- TransPacific Logistics: $320K ACV (expected close Feb 28) — new logo, enterprise segment, sourced from Q4 conference
- Global Trade Networks: $195K ACV (signed Feb 14) — new logo, mid-market segment, 14-day sales cycle (fastest enterprise close this quarter)
- 6 mid-market deals: combined $415K ACV

February deal pipeline by stage:
- Closed Won: $3.1M (14 deals)
- Commit: $1.2M (6 deals, expected close by Feb 28)
- Best Case: $2.4M (11 deals, weighted probability 45%)
- Pipeline: $4.8M (22 deals, weighted probability 20%)

Win rate analysis (February MTD):
- Enterprise: 38% (6 wins of 16 opportunities reaching decision stage)
- Mid-Market: 42% (8 wins of 19 opportunities)
- Overall: 40% (up from 35% in January)
- Primary win drivers: rec engine v3 capabilities (cited in 9 of 14 closed-won deals), Axion partnership (cited in 4 of 14)
- Primary loss drivers: pricing (3 losses), feature gaps in customs/compliance (2 losses)

III. OPERATING EXPENSES

Note: the accelerated prepaid amortization will add approximately $900K to Q1 opex. Flagging for the board package.

February operating expenses (projected): $9.6M
February budget: $9.1M
Variance: +$0.5M (unfavorable)

The unfavorable variance is driven by:
- Accelerated prepaid amortization: $300K (first month of catch-up)
- Rec engine v3 launch costs (marketing, customer communications): $100K
- 14 new hires in February (higher than planned 10): $100K in incremental payroll

Excluding the accelerated amortization, operating expenses are within budget.

IV. CASH POSITION

Cash position as of Feb 14: $26.3M. Projected Q1 ending cash: $24.2M (revised from $25.1M due to amortization acceleration).

Cash position February 14: $26.3M
Projected February end: $25.4M
Projected Q1 ending cash: $24.2M (revised down $900K from prior projection)

Cash revision drivers:
- Accelerated amortization of prepaids: does NOT affect cash (non-cash expense)
- Actual cash impact from vendor restructuring (shorter terms, higher unit costs): $55.5K
- Higher payroll from 14 February hires: $140K incremental
- Rec engine v3 launch marketing spend: $100K
- Net revision: -$296K in actual incremental cash spend
- Remainder of $900K revision is conservative buffer for March close timing

V. HEADCOUNT

Headcount: 414 (8 net adds in February through Feb 14)
February hires: 14 (8 engineering, 3 sales, 2 CS, 1 legal)
February departures: 6 (4 voluntary, 2 involuntary — all backfilled or in process)
Open positions: 30

Department breakdown:
- Engineering: 154 (37.2% of total headcount)
- Sales & Marketing: 93 (22.5%)
- Customer Success: 55 (13.3%)
- Product: 22 (5.3%)

The subscription revenue percentage (88.9%) is the highest in company history, up from 86.2% in Q4 2024. This trend is positive for margin expansion.

IX. EXPENSE VARIANCE ANALYSIS

Key expense variances for February (significant items only):

Favorable variances:
- AWS compute costs: -$147K (K8s migration savings kicking in — $208K actual vs. $355K budgeted on pre-migration basis)
- Travel and entertainment: -$28K (lighter conference schedule in February)
- Software licensing: -$15K (timing of annual renewals)

Unfavorable variances:
- Accelerated prepaid amortization: +$300K (one-time, per policy change)
- Payroll (higher hiring): +$100K (14 hires vs. 10 planned)
- Marketing (v3 launch): +$100K (launch communications, press, customer events)
- Legal (outside counsel): +$45K (Wachtell engagement — coded as "M&A advisory retainer" in the GL)

Net variance: +$455K unfavorable (but excluding one-time amortization catch-up and the Wachtell legal fees, the underlying business is tracking $40K favorable to budget)

Expense category breakdown (February projected):
- Compensation and benefits: $5.9M (61.5% of total opex)
- Cloud infrastructure (AWS, Snowflake, Datadog): $0.9M (9.4%)
- Software and tools: $0.6M (6.3%)
- Professional services: $0.5M (5.2%) — includes $45K Wachtell engagement
- Sales and marketing: $0.8M (8.3%)
- Facilities and operations: $0.5M (5.2%)
- Depreciation and amortization: $0.4M (4.2%) — includes $300K accelerated prepaid amortization

Year-over-year opex growth rate: 18.2% (in line with revenue growth of 19.4%). Opex as a percentage of revenue remains stable at 88.9%, consistent with our path to profitability timeline.

X. WORKING CAPITAL METRICS

DSO: 39 days (improved from 40 days in January)
DPO: 32 days (consistent with Q4)
Current ratio: 2.9:1 (healthy)
Quick ratio: 2.4:1

Collections continue to be strong. The automated dunning process implemented in December is showing results — we've reduced the 60+ day aging bucket from $1.1M at year-end to $0.4M at mid-February.

XI. LOOKING AHEAD — MARCH PREVIEW

March is typically our strongest month within Q1 due to quarter-end close dynamics and enterprise procurement timelines. Based on current pipeline and weighted forecast:

Projected March revenue: $11.0M (10% above plan)
Projected March bookings: $5.8M (strongest month of Q1)
Projected Q1 total revenue: $31.8M (7% above $29.7M plan)

Key March events and their financial implications:
- SOC 2 Type II audit (March 3-21): estimated audit cost $85K, critical for enterprise sales pipeline
- Supply chain dashboard redesign GA launch: marketing spend $60K allocated, expected to drive 15-20 enterprise trial requests
- Axion integration internal demo (completed Feb 28): no direct P&L impact, but beta launch in June positions us for H2 upsell revenue
- Q1 close and reporting: final close by April 5, board presentation April 10
- Employee engagement survey (March 3-17): administered by Culture Amp, cost $12K, results expected March 24
- 13th floor office occupancy (March 1): lease commencement at $32/sq ft annualized, monthly cost $21.3K

The business is performing well and we are on track for our best Q1 in company history.

XII. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AGING

Current aging summary as of February 14, 2025:

| Aging Bucket     | Amount     | % of Total | Change vs. Jan 31 |
|------------------|------------|------------|--------------------|
| Current (0-30)   | $8.2M      | 76.6%      | +$0.4M            |
| 31-60 days       | $1.9M      | 17.8%      | -$0.1M            |
| 61-90 days       | $0.4M      | 3.7%       | -$0.3M            |
| 91+ days         | $0.2M      | 1.9%       | -$0.1M            |
| Total AR         | $10.7M     | 100%       | -$0.1M            |

The reduction in 60+ day aging is a direct result of the automated dunning process implemented in December. The 91+ day balance of $0.2M consists of two accounts: one disputed invoice ($120K, in resolution with legal) and one slow-paying government entity ($80K, payment confirmed for March 3).

Bad debt reserve: $180K (1.7% of total AR). No write-offs recommended this period.

XIII. CAPITAL EXPENDITURE

February capex (MTD): $42K
- Hardware refresh for QA lab: $28K (8 workstations)
- Network equipment for 13th floor buildout: $14K (switches, access points, cabling)

Q1 capex budget: $180K
Q1 capex spent (YTD): $97K (54% of quarterly budget)
Remaining Q1 capex: $83K (allocated for 13th floor office buildout completion)

Note: the 13th floor lease (18 months, $8,000 sq ft) is on an accelerated build-out schedule with occupancy targeted for March 1. Total build-out cost: $320K (landlord contribution: $200K, Nextera contribution: $120K).
