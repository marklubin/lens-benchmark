PEOPLE TEAM POLICY BULLETIN

To: All Nextera Employees
From: Vanessa Kline, VP People
Date: February 2, 2025

UPDATED EQUITY ACCELERATION POLICY — EFFECTIVE MARCH 1, 2025

We are updating our equity acceleration policy effective March 1, 2025, to align with market best practices.

The Board of Directors approved this policy update at the January 21, 2025 board meeting. The update modernizes our equity acceleration framework to reflect current market standards based on the Compensia 2024 Executive Compensation Survey and peer group benchmarking.

KEY CHANGES

We're introducing a "qualifying event" definition that standardizes how equity acceleration works across the company. This is a routine update to ensure our equity program remains competitive.

1. QUALIFYING EVENT DEFINITION (NEW)

A qualifying event includes: change of control (acquisition of 50%+ of voting shares or substantially all assets), initial public offering, or a specified asset sale exceeding $50M.

Specifically, a "qualifying event" is defined as:

(a) Change of Control — the acquisition by any person or entity of 50% or more of the outstanding voting shares of Nextera Solutions, Inc., or the sale or transfer of substantially all of the assets of the company;

(b) Initial Public Offering — the completion of an initial public offering of the company's common stock registered under the Securities Act of 1933;

(c) Specified Asset Sale — the sale, transfer, or disposition of assets of the company with an aggregate fair market value exceeding $50 million, excluding ordinary course transactions.

2. ACCELERATION TIERS

Upon the occurrence of a qualifying event, equity acceleration will be determined based on the employee's role level:

Tier 1 — C-Suite Executives (CEO, CFO, CTO, General Counsel, VP People):
- Single-trigger acceleration
- 100% of unvested equity accelerates immediately upon a qualifying event
- No additional conditions required
- C-suite executives receive single-trigger acceleration on qualifying event

Tier 2 — VP-Level Executives:
- Double-trigger acceleration
- 100% of unvested equity accelerates upon a qualifying event AND involuntary termination without cause (or resignation for good reason) within 12 months following the qualifying event
- VP-level double-trigger: 100% acceleration on qualifying event + termination within 12 months

Tier 3 — All Other Employees:
- Double-trigger acceleration
- 50% of unvested equity accelerates upon a qualifying event AND involuntary termination without cause (or resignation for good reason) within 12 months following the qualifying event
- All other employees: double-trigger, 50% acceleration

3. PREVIOUS POLICY

The previous policy provided double-trigger acceleration for all employees (including C-suite) with 100% acceleration upon change of control plus involuntary termination. The updated policy differentiates by role level and introduces single-trigger for C-suite, which is consistent with market practice for companies at our stage and size.

WHY THIS CHANGE

This update ensures that our equity program is competitive with the market and appropriately rewards employees at all levels. The Compensia 2024 survey data shows that 72% of venture-backed enterprise software companies with $100M+ ARR offer single-trigger acceleration for C-suite executives, while 85% offer double-trigger for all other employees.

Our goal is to attract and retain the best talent, and having a competitive equity program is a critical component of that strategy.

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU

For the vast majority of employees (Tier 3), the key change is:
- Previously: 100% acceleration upon change of control + involuntary termination
- Now: 50% acceleration upon qualifying event + involuntary termination within 12 months

For VP-level employees (Tier 2):
- Previously: 100% acceleration upon change of control + involuntary termination
- Now: 100% acceleration upon qualifying event + involuntary termination within 12 months (substantively unchanged, but now includes IPO and asset sale as qualifying events in addition to change of control)

IMPORTANT CONTEXT

This policy update is independent of any corporate strategy or plans. The company regularly updates its compensation and equity policies to reflect market best practices. The addition of "initial public offering" as a qualifying event is not an indication that an IPO is being planned. Similarly, the inclusion of "change of control" is a standard provision in equity plans at companies of our size and stage.

If you have questions about how this policy affects your specific equity grant, the following resources are available:

1. FAQ Document: Posted on the HR intranet under Equity > Policies > Acceleration Policy FAQ
2. Information Session: February 10, 2025, 2:00 PM, main auditorium (also on Zoom)
3. 1:1 with HR: Schedule through people@nextera.io
4. Shareworks Portal: Log in to view your current equity grants, vesting schedule, and accelerated quantities under each scenario

The information session on February 10 will include a detailed walkthrough of the policy, example scenarios for each tier, and a Q&A session. I encourage everyone to attend.

LEGAL REVIEW

This policy update was reviewed and approved by:
- Rachel Dominguez, General Counsel (legal review)
- Nathan Foley, Senior Corporate Counsel (employment law compliance)
- Outside counsel: Cooley LLP (California employment law review)
- Board of Directors: approved January 21, 2025

The policy is compliant with all applicable California labor laws and SEC regulations.

EFFECTIVE DATE

The updated policy is effective March 1, 2025. All equity grants issued before March 1 will be governed by the new policy terms effective March 1. There is no grandfathering of the previous acceleration terms.

If you have any questions, please reach out to the People Team at people@nextera.io.

EQUITY PROGRAM OVERVIEW — FOR REFERENCE

Since we're updating the acceleration policy, this is a good opportunity to provide a comprehensive overview of Nextera's equity compensation program for those who want the full picture.

Current Equity Plan Statistics:
- Total equity plan participants: 380 of 406 employees (93.6%)
- Total unvested equity pool: $68M at current 409A valuation ($14.20/share)
- Total vested equity held by employees: $42M at current 409A valuation
- Standard vesting schedule: 4 years with 1-year cliff (25% vests at year 1, monthly vesting thereafter)
- Equity refresh grants: eligible after 2 years of tenure, at manager discretion
- Current 409A valuation: $14.20/share (last updated October 2024)
- Next 409A valuation: scheduled for April 2025

Equity Grant Tiers (for new hire offers):
- C-Suite: 0.5% - 2.0% of fully diluted shares
- VP-Level: 0.15% - 0.5%
- Director-Level: 0.05% - 0.15%
- Senior Individual Contributor: 0.02% - 0.05%
- Individual Contributor: 0.01% - 0.03%

ESPP (Employee Stock Purchase Plan):
- Discount: 15% off the lower of grant date or exercise date fair market value
- Purchase periods: 6 months
- Contribution limit: up to 15% of base salary (capped at IRS limit)
- Current participation rate: 62%

For those who want to model the value of their equity under different scenarios, the Shareworks portal includes a grant calculator. You can input different share prices and see the estimated value of your vested and unvested equity. The calculator does not constitute financial advice — please consult your financial advisor for personalized guidance.

TAX IMPLICATIONS

Important tax notes regarding equity acceleration:
- Acceleration of unvested options or RSUs may trigger tax obligations depending on your grant type
- ISO (Incentive Stock Options): acceleration may cause options to convert from ISO to NSO treatment if the $100K annual vesting limit is exceeded
- RSUs: acceleration triggers ordinary income tax on the fair market value at the time of acceleration
- NSOs: acceleration triggers ordinary income tax on the spread (exercise price vs. fair market value)

We strongly recommend consulting with a tax professional to understand the implications of acceleration for your specific situation. The company will provide tax gross-up calculations to eligible employees upon request.

TechCrunch picked up the Axion partnership: "Nextera Solutions and Axion Labs forge deep data alliance for supply chain analytics"

Link: [TechCrunch article — published February 1, 2025]

Good coverage. The article highlights the data coverage expansion (220 to 340+ lanes) and the real-time data refresh improvements. Quotes from Hannah and Kai Brennan. No speculation about anything beyond the partnership itself.

[9:34 AM] chris.nadal
Great press! This is exactly the kind of coverage we need going into Q1 pipeline generation. Already sent the link to 3 prospects.

[9:37 AM] raj.patel
Nice article. They mentioned our recommendation engine v3 too — good brand visibility.

[9:40 AM] lauren.sinclair
for everyone still panicking: Axion raised $45M total. we do $120M ARR. the math doesn't math on them acquiring us :face_with_rolling_eyes:

[9:43 AM] carlos.rivera
fair point lol. also the article describes it as a "data alliance" which is very different from an acquisition. the press seems to see it as a product play, not a corporate move.

[9:46 AM] kenji.tanaka
I actually went and read Axion's press release too. Their CEO Kai Brennan talks about it purely as a technology partnership. He says "Nextera is the clear leader in supply chain intelligence and we're honored to bring our data to their platform." That doesn't sound like someone planning to buy us.

[9:49 AM] grace.zhou
the equity policy update is interesting timing though... "qualifying events"... just saying :eyes:

[9:52 AM] sami.okoro
can we please stop speculating on slack, some of us are trying to ship code

[9:55 AM] amara.williams
+1 to Sami. The equity update was announced as a routine market alignment. The FAQ on the intranet is very clear. Can we focus on work?

[9:58 AM] fatima.al-rashid
Genuinely asking — has anyone read the Compensia survey data that the equity policy references? It does show that single-trigger for C-suite is standard at companies our size. 72% of comparable companies do it. So the "routine" explanation is consistent with the data.

[10:02 AM] owen.park
I work in finance and I can tell you that equity policy updates happen regularly at growing companies. We updated the ESPP terms in Q3 2024 and nobody panicked about that. This is the same kind of thing.

[10:05 AM] devi.krishnan
I get why people are curious about the timing — Axion partnership + equity policy update in the same week. But correlation isn't causation. Companies do multiple things at once. That's called running a business.

[10:08 AM] carlos.rivera
:thumbsup: fair. I'll shut up about it. back to writing code.

[10:12 AM] tomas.lindgren
From CS perspective — the TechCrunch article is great for customer conversations. Three of my enterprise accounts have already sent me the article asking about the Axion data. The response is very positive.

[10:15 AM] ben.arujo
@tomas.lindgren Great to hear! Customer talking points were distributed this morning via Amanda's team. Please use those as the basis for customer conversations.

[10:18 AM] hannah.choi
Thanks everyone for the positive energy around the TechCrunch coverage. A few updates from my side:

1. The Axion integration sprint started today. Four Axion engineers are in the office — please welcome them if you see them around the 14th floor.

2. Customer response to the partnership has been overwhelmingly positive. We've received inbound inquiries from 8 enterprise prospects who saw the press release and want to learn more about our platform. Kevin's team is handling the follow-up.

3. The joint blog post with Kai Brennan went live this morning on the Nextera blog. Please share it on your LinkedIn if you're comfortable doing so.

[10:22 AM] kevin.orosco
Can confirm — 8 inbound inquiries since the press release went live. Three are enterprise-quality leads. This partnership is already generating pipeline. :chart_with_upwards_trend:

[10:25 AM] diana.marsh
I've already gotten three calls from existing customers congratulating us on the partnership. The supply chain industry is small — news travels fast. This kind of positive market perception is invaluable for sales.

[10:28 AM] amanda.briggs
Customer FAQ is live on the intranet. Key talking points for CS:
1. The Axion data integration is a product enhancement — no disruption to existing service
2. Beta access available June 2025 for interested customers
3. Pricing details for the enhanced data tier will be communicated by May
4. No customer data is shared with Axion
5. All data processing meets our existing SOC 2 and data privacy standards

Please use these talking points for all customer conversations about the partnership.

[10:32 AM] frank.gutierrez
Security note: I've completed the security review of the Axion integration architecture. All data flows are encrypted (TLS 1.3 in transit, AES-256 at rest). Axion's SOC 2 Type II report is clean. No security concerns with the integration.

[10:35 AM] carlos.rivera
Love the positive momentum. This is a great way to start February. :rocket:

Thread statistics:
- 31 replies over 2 hours
- Employee who noted Axion's funding size received 22 upvotes
- Equity policy comment received 18 :eyes: reactions
- Thread tone was calmer than the January 30 speculation thread
- No HR intervention needed — conversation self-moderated

Subject: RE: Executive Agreement Amendments — Board Approval

Nathan,

Board approved the amendments on January 21. Please prepare final execution copies for all 14 executives.

The amendments incorporate the following changes (as discussed in your January 24 memo):

C-Suite Executives (5 agreements):
- Single-trigger acceleration: 100% of unvested equity upon qualifying event
- Severance: 24 months base salary + target bonus upon involuntary termination
- Definition of qualifying event expanded to include IPO and asset sale >$50M
- Non-compete: 18 months post-termination (increased from 12 months)
- Non-solicitation: 24 months post-termination (unchanged)

VP-Level Executives (9 agreements):
- Double-trigger acceleration: 100% of unvested equity upon qualifying event + involuntary termination within 12 months
- Severance: 12 months base salary upon involuntary termination
- Definition of qualifying event expanded (same as C-suite)
- Non-compete: 12 months post-termination (unchanged)
- Non-solicitation: 18 months post-termination (unchanged)

Target: all agreements re-executed by February 14.

Please prepare the following for each executive:
1. Amendment agreement (clean version for signature)
2. Redline showing changes from current agreement
3. Summary term sheet highlighting key changes
4. Individual equity impact analysis (current unvested shares, estimated value at current 409A of $14.20/share, estimated accelerated value)

The individual equity impact analysis is important. Each executive should understand the specific financial impact of the new provisions. The total estimated equity value subject to acceleration at current 409A is $42M across all 14 executives. Please break this out by individual.

Also, I'd like you to begin preparing summary of all change-of-control related provisions across the company.

Specifically, I want a comprehensive inventory of all agreements — employment, vendor, customer, and lease — that contain change-of-control provisions, assignment restrictions, or consent requirements. This includes:

- Employment agreements: 14 executive agreements (being amended now)
- Vendor contracts: 142 active contracts — scan for CoC notification, consent, or termination provisions
- Customer agreements: 218 active customer contracts — scan for assignment restrictions and CoC consent requirements
- Lease agreements: 3 active leases (14th floor HQ, parking level, warehouse/data center)

Target for exec agreement re-execution: February 14. Target for the comprehensive CoC summary: February 28.

I know this is a significant workload. I've authorized one paralegal (Jennifer Walsh) to assist full-time on the contract review. She can handle the initial scan of vendor and customer contracts; you should focus on the executive agreements and the lease analysis.

Please give me a progress update by February 7.

Rachel

Subject: RE: Executive Agreement Amendments — Board Approval

Rachel,

Acknowledged on all items. I'll begin preparing the executive agreement amendments today. A few preliminary notes:

1. The 14 executive agreements currently use three different template versions (2020, 2022, and 2023 templates). For consistency, I recommend using the 2023 template as the base for all amendments. This means some of the older agreements will need more extensive redlining.

2. On the comprehensive CoC review: the scope is significant. Employment agreements are straightforward (14 documents, I know the provisions). Vendor contracts (142) and customer agreements (218) will take more time. Jennifer can handle the initial keyword scan (searching for "change of control," "assignment," "consent," "successor," "transferability" across all agreements), but I'll need to review any flagged agreements individually.

Preliminary estimate:
- Executive agreements: ready for signature by February 10 (4 days ahead of target)
- Vendor CoC scan: complete by February 14
- Customer CoC scan: complete by February 21
- Lease CoC analysis: complete by February 14 (only 3 leases)
- Comprehensive summary document: complete by February 28 (on target)

3. On the individual equity impact analysis: I'll coordinate with Vanessa Kline's team to get the current vesting schedules from Shareworks. I'll need access to the cap table as well — can you authorize me to pull it from Angela Torres?

4. One question: for the comprehensive CoC summary, should I include the Axion Labs partnership agreement? It was just signed this week and I haven't reviewed the final terms. If there's a CoC provision in that agreement, it should be included in the inventory.

5. I've done a preliminary scan of the lease agreements (since we only have 3, this was quick):

   a. 14th Floor HQ (655 Montgomery, SF): 7-year lease, expires June 2028. Contains assignment restriction requiring landlord written consent for any assignment or sublease, including by operation of law (which would include a change of control in most interpretations). Notice period: 30 days. Risk: medium (the landlord is a large institutional REIT and typically consents with reasonable conditions, but consent is not guaranteed).

   b. Parking Level (655 Montgomery garage): 3-year lease, expires December 2026. Contains standard assignment clause requiring landlord notice within 30 days. Does NOT require consent for CoC, only for direct assignment or sublease. Risk: low.

   c. Warehouse/Data Center (South San Francisco): 5-year lease, expires March 2027. Contains assignment restriction similar to the HQ lease — requires landlord written consent for assignment. Risk: medium (different landlord, smaller property management company, less predictable).

   All three leases contain a "change of ownership" provision that defines the sale or transfer of 50%+ of outstanding equity as an assignment for purposes of the lease. This is common in commercial leases and means we would need to obtain landlord consent for any change of control transaction.

   I'll have the full lease analysis with landlord contact information and recommended approach by February 14.

6. For the vendor and customer contract scans — Jennifer Walsh starts the keyword search tomorrow. I've given her access to the SharePoint document library where all contracts are stored. Estimated volume: approximately 360 documents to review (142 vendor + 218 customer). The keyword search will identify approximately 20-30% as containing relevant provisions, which she'll flag for my detailed review.

Subject: RE: Executive Agreement Amendments — Board Approval

Nathan,

Good notes on all points. Responses:

1. Yes, use the 2023 template as the base. Consistency is important here.

2. Timeline looks reasonable. If Jennifer needs help on the keyword scan, let me know and I'll authorize a second paralegal.

3. Yes, you're authorized to pull the cap table from Angela. Coordinate directly with her. And Vanessa's team can provide vesting data from Shareworks — I'll send her a heads up.

4. Yes, include the Axion Labs agreement in the comprehensive review. Include every agreement the company is party to, regardless of when it was signed. I want a complete picture.

On scope: the comprehensive CoC summary should categorize each agreement as follows:
- Category A: Requires counterparty consent (i.e., we must obtain the other party's affirmative consent before a CoC event)
- Category B: Requires notification only (i.e., we must notify the other party within a specified time frame after a CoC event, but no consent is required)
- Category C: Contains termination-for-convenience provisions triggered by CoC (i.e., the counterparty has the right to terminate upon a CoC event)
- Category D: No CoC provisions

For each agreement in Categories A, B, or C, I want the following details documented:
1. Counterparty name
2. Agreement type (vendor, customer, lease)
3. Annual contract value
4. CoC provision type (consent, notification, termination)
5. Required notice period (e.g., 30 days, 60 days)
6. Risk assessment (high, medium, low) based on strategic importance and counterparty relationship
7. Recommended approach (early outreach, standard process, or no action needed)

This level of detail is important for our overall corporate governance posture. As we grow and mature as a company, having a clear understanding of our contractual obligations in various scenarios is essential. This is consistent with the kind of corporate governance review that any well-run enterprise software company at our scale would undertake.

Timeline summary:
- Executive agreements re-execution: February 14
- Vendor CoC scan: February 14
- Lease CoC analysis: February 14
- Customer CoC scan: February 21
- Comprehensive summary with risk assessment: February 28

Let me know if you need anything else.

ENGINEERING MEMORANDUM

To: All Engineering Team Members
From: Marcus Webb, VP Engineering
Date: February 2, 2025

KUBERNETES 1.29 PRODUCTION MIGRATION — GO DECISION

We have a GO for K8s 1.29 production migration. Cutover begins Feb 5 at 02:00 PST. Lisa's team owns the migration; all other teams should be available for verification.

After thorough review of all readiness criteria, I am confirming the Go decision for the Kubernetes 1.29 production migration. This is the biggest infrastructure change we've made in 2 years. Let's execute cleanly.

MIGRATION TIMELINE

Monday, February 3:
- Pre-migration verification checks (automated suite runs at 10 AM)
- All teams verify their services are properly containerized and K8s manifests are up to date
- Final staging validation by platform team
- Go/no-go checkpoint: 4 PM (must clear all readiness gates)

Tuesday, February 4:
- Final configuration freeze at 12 PM (no production changes after this point)
- On-call team briefing at 6 PM in the Alcatraz conference room
- Platform team begins pre-migration DNS configuration
- Customer-facing status page updated with maintenance window notice

Wednesday, February 5: PRIMARY CUTOVER
- 02:00 PST: Migration begins. Traffic routing starts shifting to K8s cluster.
- 02:30: Checkpoint 1 — 10% of traffic on K8s, verify all health checks green
- 03:00: Checkpoint 2 — 25% of traffic on K8s
- 03:30: Checkpoint 3 — 50% of traffic on K8s
- 04:00: Checkpoint 4 — 75% of traffic on K8s
- 04:30: Checkpoint 5 — 100% of traffic on K8s
- 05:00-06:00: Monitoring and verification period
- 06:00: Migration window closes. If all metrics are green, migration is declared complete.

Thursday, February 6:
- 24-hour monitoring period. Platform team on high alert.
- Performance baseline comparison: old infrastructure vs. new
- Cost analysis: compute spend comparison

Friday, February 7:
- Post-mortem meeting, 10:00 AM, Golden Gate conference room
- Documentation and lessons learned
- (Also: Hackathon starts at 5 PM!)

ROLLBACK CRITERIA

Rollback criteria: if p99 latency exceeds 500ms for more than 10 minutes, or if error rate exceeds 0.5%, we roll back immediately.

Automatic rollback triggers (any ONE of these sustained for 10+ consecutive minutes):
1. p99 latency > 500ms
2. Error rate > 0.5% (HTTP 5xx responses)
3. Customer-facing availability < 99.5%
4. Database connection pool exhaustion
5. Any P1 incident declared during migration window

Manual rollback decision authority:
- Primary: Lisa Chen (migration lead)
- Secondary: Marcus Webb (VP Engineering)
- Tertiary: Sami Okoro (engineering manager on-call)

Rollback procedure has been tested 3 times in staging. Average rollback time: 11 minutes. Maximum observed: 14 minutes. All tests resulted in zero customer-facing impact during rollback.

ON-CALL ASSIGNMENTS

Shift 1 (02:00-10:00 PST) — Migration execution:
- Lisa Chen (Platform Director, Migration Lead)
- Tyler Kim (Platform Engineer)
- Amara Williams (Senior Engineer, Infrastructure)
- Devi Krishnan (Data Engineer, Pipeline Verification)

Shift 2 (10:00-18:00 PST) — Day monitoring:
- Raj Patel (Senior Engineer, API verification)
- Carlos Rivera (Software Engineer, Service verification)
- Ethan Novak (Software Engineer, Frontend verification)

Shift 3 (18:00-02:00 PST) — Evening monitoring:
- Sami Okoro (Engineering Manager, escalation point)
- Grace Zhou (QA Engineer, automated test suite monitoring)

All teams: be available for verification of your services during the migration window. Each team lead should verify their service health within 30 minutes of the 100% traffic shift (approximately 05:00 PST).

CUSTOMER COMMUNICATION

Amanda Briggs's CS team sent a maintenance window notification to all customers on January 24. The notification stated:

"Nextera Solutions will be performing scheduled infrastructure maintenance on February 5, 2025, between 2:00 AM and 6:00 AM Pacific Standard Time. During this window, you may experience brief periods of elevated latency. No downtime is expected. If you have questions, please contact your Customer Success Manager."

Zero customer inquiries received about the maintenance window as of today.

EXPECTED OUTCOMES

Upon successful migration, we expect:
- Latency improvement: p99 from 380ms to ~290ms (based on staging data)
- Cost reduction: ~42% reduction in monthly compute spend ($350K to ~$210K)
- Scalability: auto-scaling from 0 to 3x peak traffic in under 60 seconds (vs. 15 minutes with current EC2 instances)
- Reliability: self-healing containers with automatic restart on failure

This migration is a significant step forward for our infrastructure. The team has done exceptional preparation and I'm confident in our ability to execute cleanly.

If you have questions, reach out to Lisa Chen or me directly. Let's make this happen.

INFRASTRUCTURE COMPARISON

For anyone interested in the technical details, here's a comparison of the current and target architectures:

Current Architecture (EC2-based):
- 94 EC2 instances across 3 AWS regions (us-west-2, us-east-1, eu-west-1)
- Manual scaling: capacity changes require provisioning new instances (15-20 minute lead time)
- Deployment method: Blue-green deployment with Ansible playbooks
- Monitoring: Datadog with custom dashboards
- Load balancing: AWS ALB with manual target group management
- Cost: ~$350K/month compute

Target Architecture (EKS/K8s 1.29):
- EKS cluster with auto-scaling node groups (target: 45 node groups)
- Auto-scaling: Kubernetes HPA scales pods in 30-60 seconds, Karpenter provisions nodes in 2-3 minutes
- Deployment method: GitOps with ArgoCD
- Monitoring: Datadog with K8s-native dashboards (updated in January)
- Load balancing: AWS ALB Ingress Controller with automatic target registration
- Service mesh: Istio for inter-service communication and traffic management
- Cost: ~$210K/month compute (estimated)

Migration scope:
- 47 microservices to migrate
- 12 background workers
- 8 scheduled jobs (cron)
- 3 API gateways
- 1 WebSocket service
- Total Kubernetes manifests: 312 files (Helm charts + Kustomize overlays)

Database layer (NOT migrating — remains on RDS):
- Primary: PostgreSQL 15.4 on RDS Multi-AZ (db.r6g.4xlarge)
- Read replicas: 3 (one per region)
- Redis: ElastiCache cluster for caching
- Elasticsearch: OpenSearch for search functionality

The database decision to remain on RDS was intentional — we assessed the risk of migrating both compute and database simultaneously and determined it was unnecessary. The compute-only migration significantly reduces the blast radius of any issues.

POST-MIGRATION SUPPORT

If you experience any issues with your services after the migration:
1. Check the #k8s-migration Slack channel for known issues
2. Review the Datadog dashboard: K8s Production > Service Health
3. If your service is unhealthy, check the pod logs: `kubectl logs -n <namespace> <pod-name>`
4. For urgent issues during the migration window, page the on-call via PagerDuty
5. For non-urgent issues after the migration window, file a JIRA ticket tagged with "k8s-migration"

FAQ:
Q: Will my CI/CD pipeline change?
A: No. We've already migrated CI/CD to target K8s in staging. The same pipeline configuration will work for production.

Q: Do I need to update my local development environment?
A: No immediate changes needed. We recommend installing kubectl and Lens (K8s IDE) for debugging, but it's not required.

Q: What about secrets management?
A: We're using AWS Secrets Manager with the External Secrets Operator for K8s. All existing secrets have been migrated and verified.

Q: Will monitoring dashboards change?
A: Yes, some Datadog dashboards have been updated to reflect K8s-native metrics (pod CPU/memory, replica counts, etc.). Bookmarked dashboards may need to be updated. Check #k8s-migration for links to new dashboards.

Thank you for your attention and preparation. Let's execute this migration cleanly and celebrate at the hackathon on Friday.
