I. CALL TO ORDER AND APPROVAL OF PRIOR MINUTES

Board Chair Robert Kessler called the meeting to order at 9:02 AM. Mr. Kessler confirmed attendance and the presence of a quorum. The minutes from the October 14, 2024 regular meeting were presented for approval. Mr. Kessler noted that one minor correction had been submitted by Ms. Jiang regarding the phrasing of a resolution on the equity incentive plan amendment; the correction was noted and incorporated into the final version of the October minutes. Upon motion by Ms. Patel, seconded by Mr. Whitfield, the Board unanimously approved the prior meeting minutes as amended.

Mr. Kessler welcomed the Board to the first meeting of 2025 and noted the packed agenda covering Q4 performance review, financial position, the 2025 Operating Plan, governance matters, and the executive session. He proposed proceeding with Mr. Aldric's Q4 review, followed by Ms. Vasquez's financial report, before moving to the operating plan vote. The Board agreed to the proposed order of proceedings.

II. CEO REPORT — Q4 2024 PERFORMANCE REVIEW

Mr. Aldric presented the Q4 2024 performance review to the Board. The presentation consisted of 34 slides covering revenue performance, customer acquisition, competitive dynamics, product milestones, and operational highlights for the quarter ending December 31, 2024. A printed copy of the slide deck was distributed to each Board member.

Mr. Aldric reported that Q4 revenue came in at $31.2M against a target of $30.5M, representing a beat of approximately 2.3% over plan. He noted that the outperformance was driven by three large enterprise deals that closed in the final two weeks of December, each above $250K in annual contract value. Mr. Aldric walked the Board through the customer acquisition funnel, noting that the enterprise pipeline had been strong throughout Q4 with particular strength in the transportation and logistics vertical.

Mr. Aldric: "We closed 14 new enterprise logos in Q4, bringing our total customer count to 218. Net revenue retention is 119%."

He then discussed the composition of the customer base by segment. Of the 218 total customers, 82 were classified as enterprise (greater than $100K ACV), 94 as mid-market ($25K-$100K ACV), and 42 as emerging ($10K-$25K ACV). Mr. Aldric noted that the enterprise segment had grown from 68 customers at the start of Q4, representing a net addition of 14 new enterprise logos during the quarter.

Mr. Aldric reviewed the product roadmap milestones achieved in Q4. The recommendation engine v2.4 release shipped on schedule in October and had been adopted by 34% of the customer base by end of quarter. The supply chain analytics dashboard received a significant update in November with new predictive capabilities that had contributed to several competitive wins. The API gateway was upgraded in December to support higher throughput requirements from the largest customers.

Ms. Jiang asked about the company's competitive positioning in the mid-market segment, specifically against Palantir, which had been increasing its presence in deals under $500K ACV.

Ms. Jiang: "What is our win rate against Palantir in deals under $500K ACV?"

Mr. Aldric: "Approximately 62% in that segment, up from 54% in Q3."

Mr. Aldric elaborated that the win rate improvement was driven by the deployment of the recommendation engine v2 release in October, which had been well received by mid-market prospects during proof-of-concept evaluations. He provided examples of two competitive displacements in Q4 where the recommendation engine functionality was a deciding factor in the customer's vendor selection process. He noted that Palantir's pricing in the sub-$500K segment had become more aggressive in Q4, but that Nextera's product differentiation — specifically real-time supply chain visibility and the recommendation engine's ability to process multi-modal logistics data — continued to be the primary win driver.

Mr. Whitfield asked about gross margin trends and whether the competitive pricing pressure from Palantir had required any discounting that might affect margins. Ms. Vasquez responded that gross margin for Q4 was 78.3%, in line with the trailing four-quarter average of 78.1%. She noted that average selling price had remained stable and that the handful of deals where competitive discounting had been applied were offset by strong expansion pricing within the existing customer base. She noted that professional services revenue had been stable and that the gross margin reflected an increasing mix of subscription revenue relative to professional services.

Ms. Patel asked about customer churn in Q4. Mr. Aldric responded that gross revenue retention was 94% on a trailing twelve-month basis, with two small customer losses in Q4 totaling approximately $180K in ARR. Both losses were attributed to the customers' own business closures rather than competitive displacement or product dissatisfaction.

III. CFO REPORT — FINANCIAL POSITION

Ms. Vasquez presented the financial position of the company as of December 31, 2024. The presentation included audited balance sheet data, cash flow statements, and key financial metrics. The following highlights were reported:

Cash and Cash Equivalents: $28.4M
Short-term Investments: $0 (all cash held in operating and money market accounts)
Credit Facility: $15M revolving credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank, currently undrawn
Total Debt: None (the company has no term debt outstanding)
Accounts Receivable: $14.2M (Days Sales Outstanding: 42 days)
Accounts Payable: $4.8M
Deferred Revenue: $22.8M
Total Stockholders' Equity: $62.4M

Ms. Vasquez noted that the company's cash position remained strong and that the operating plan for FY2025 did not contemplate the need for additional equity or debt financing. She stated that at the current burn rate, the company had approximately 24 months of runway. She noted that the credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank was available as a backstop but that management did not anticipate drawing on it.

Q4 2024 ARR: $118.7M, up from $104.2M at Q4 2023, representing approximately 14% year-over-year growth. Ms. Vasquez walked through the quarterly cash flow statement, noting that Q4 free cash flow was approximately negative $1.0M, an improvement from negative $2.1M in Q3 and negative $3.4M in Q2. She attributed the improvement to operating leverage as revenue scaled while headcount growth was held to planned levels.

Ms. Vasquez presented a summary of working capital metrics. The company's current ratio was 2.8:1, reflecting a strong liquidity position. She noted that the deferred revenue balance of $22.8M was the highest in the company's history and reflected the shift toward annual and multi-year prepaid contracts in the enterprise segment.

Mr. Kessler asked about the interest rate on the revolving credit facility. Ms. Vasquez responded that the facility carried SOFR plus 175 basis points, with an annual commitment fee of 25 basis points on undrawn amounts. The facility was set to mature in June 2026 and management planned to renew on similar terms.

IV. 2025 OPERATING PLAN

Mr. Aldric presented the 2025 Operating Plan for Board approval. The presentation was 42 slides, covering financial targets, headcount plan, product roadmap, go-to-market strategy, infrastructure investments, and risk factors. A bound copy of the full operating plan document was distributed to each Board member.

Key elements of the 2025 Operating Plan:

Revenue Target: $142M ARR by December 31, 2025 (approximately 20% YoY growth)
Headcount: Increase from 402 to 465 FTEs
New Logo Target: 50+ enterprise customers
Gross Margin Target: 78-80%
EBITDA Target: Breakeven by Q4 2025
Total Operating Budget: $108.6M
Capital Expenditures: $12.6M

Mr. Aldric walked through the revenue build, starting from the $118.7M ARR base and adding planned new logo acquisition, expansion, and accounting for expected churn. He noted that the plan assumed a conservative churn rate of approximately 5% and that the $142M target required approximately $28M in net new ARR through a combination of new logos and expansion within the installed base.

The Board discussed the plan at length. Ms. Patel inquired about the assumptions underlying the headcount increase, specifically the split between revenue-generating roles and support functions. Mr. Aldric noted that approximately 40% of the net new hires would be in Engineering (approximately 25 positions), 30% in Sales (approximately 19 positions), and the remainder split across Customer Success, Product, and G&A functions.

Mr. Whitfield asked about the product roadmap's major bets for 2025. Mr. Aldric noted three key initiatives: the recommendation engine v3 general availability release (targeted for February 2025), the supply chain dashboard redesign (targeted for March), and a potential data partnership with Axion Labs that was in the evaluation phase. He emphasized that the roadmap was designed to strengthen the company's competitive position in the enterprise segment while expanding into adjacent use cases.

Mr. Kessler asked about the capital expenditure assumptions in the plan. Ms. Vasquez responded that the $12.6M capex budget was primarily allocated to infrastructure migration — the Kubernetes project — at approximately $5.8M, office expansion at $3.2M (15th floor buildout and furniture), and the remainder split across lab equipment, testing infrastructure, and miscellaneous IT capital.

Ms. Jiang asked about the competitive landscape assumptions in the plan. Mr. Aldric noted that the plan assumed continued pricing pressure from Palantir in the mid-market and potential new entrants in the supply chain intelligence space, but that Nextera's product differentiation and net revenue retention metrics provided a strong defensive moat.

Board unanimously approves 2025 operating plan with $142M revenue target.

RESOLVED: The Board approves the 2025 Operating Plan as presented, with authorized headcount increase from 402 to 465 FTEs.

Upon motion by Mr. Whitfield, seconded by Ms. Jiang, the resolution was adopted unanimously with all five Board members voting in favor. The Corporate Secretary recorded the vote.

V. GOVERNANCE MATTERS

Mr. Kessler motioned to ratify the appointment of two new independent auditors to supplement the existing Ernst & Young engagement for the FY2024 annual audit. The two additional auditors, Margaret Wu, CPA, and Samuel Greenbaum, CPA, were recommended by the Audit Committee following a review of their qualifications and independence. The Audit Committee had confirmed that neither Ms. Wu nor Mr. Greenbaum had any conflicts of interest or material relationships with the company.

Mr. Kessler noted that the additional auditors were brought on to support the expanded scope of the FY2024 audit, which included new revenue recognition procedures and the initial assessment of the company's internal controls in anticipation of potential future reporting requirements. He stated that the Audit Committee had thoroughly vetted both candidates and was satisfied with their qualifications.

Upon motion by Mr. Kessler, seconded by Ms. Patel, the Board unanimously ratified the appointments.

Ms. Fuentes presented the upcoming Board calendar for review:
  - February 10, 2025: Regular meeting (January financial review)
  - April 14, 2025: Regular meeting (Q1 2025 review)
  - June 9, 2025: Annual meeting of stockholders
  - July 14, 2025: Regular meeting (Q2 2025 review)
  - October 13, 2025: Regular meeting (Q3 2025 review)

The Board confirmed the calendar as presented. Mr. Kessler noted that the next Board meeting was scheduled for February 10, 2025, at which time the Board would receive the January financial update and a progress report on the 2025 Operating Plan.

VI. EXECUTIVE SESSION

At 10:45 AM, the Board entered executive session with only independent directors and the CEO present. The Corporate Secretary was excused from the executive session. The executive session lasted approximately 30 minutes. No formal actions were taken during the executive session.

VII. ADJOURNMENT

There being no further business, upon motion by Ms. Jiang, seconded by Mr. Whitfield, the meeting was adjourned at 11:16 AM Pacific Standard Time.

Respectfully submitted,

Maria Fuentes

Subject: FY2025 Budget Finalization — Action Items

Team,

Happy New Year. I hope everyone had a restful break.

With the board meeting behind us this morning, the 2025 Operating Plan is now officially approved. That means we need to move quickly on finalizing all departmental budgets and locking in our vendor renewal schedule for the year.

Here is where we are and what I need from each of you:

TOTAL FY2025 OPERATING BUDGET: $108.6M

Breakdown by department:
  R&D: $42.1M (38.8% of total operating budget)
  Sales & Marketing: $35.7M
  General & Administrative: $18.2M
  Capital Expenditures: $12.6M

Please ensure all department heads have signed off on their allocated budgets by January 15. No exceptions.

I've attached the departmental budget templates in the shared drive at Finance > FY2025 > Departmental Budgets. Each department head needs to review, approve, and sign the electronic form in DocuSign. Jordan has set up the routing — once a department head signs, it will automatically route to me for final approval.

Action Items:

1. Jordan — the vendor renewal schedule needs to reflect our standard 24-36 month commitment cycles. Let's lock that down before the board package goes out. I need the finalized vendor renewal schedule by January 17. We have 47 contracts up for renewal in FY2025, and I want to make sure we're capturing all early renewal discounts and avoiding any auto-renewal surprises. Please also flag any contracts where we have termination for convenience clauses that could give us leverage in renewal negotiations.

2. Angela — please verify the audit preparation timeline with Ernst & Young. I want to make sure we are aligned on their March window and that all Q4 revenue recognition is buttoned up. Also, please update the intercompany reconciliation for our UK subsidiary — it was flagged as an open item in the November close.

3. Derek — I need you to build the quarterly revenue waterfall model. This should show our path from $118.7M ARR to the $142M target, broken down by new logo, expansion, and churn. I'd like to review a first draft by January 13. Please pull the pipeline data from Salesforce and use last year's conversion rates as the starting assumption.

A few additional notes:

The R&D budget increase reflects the approved headcount plan. Marcus is planning to add 26 engineers in the first half, so we need to phase the hiring expense correctly in the waterfall. We should assume a 45-day ramp for new engineers before they're fully productive and billing to projects.

The S&M budget includes the expanded President's Club program that Kevin requested. I've allocated $200K for the trip plus an additional $150K in SPIFs for Q1 pipeline acceleration. Kevin's team is targeting 10 new enterprise logos in Q1 and the SPIFs are designed to accelerate proof-of-concept cycles.

G&A includes the additional office space we're leasing on the 15th floor. The lease terms are being finalized by Rachel's team. Expected occupancy is March 1. The buildout cost ($3.2M) is in the capex budget, and the annual lease expense ($680K) is in the G&A budget.

One more thing — I'd like to schedule our annual planning offsite for the Finance team. Last year we did Big Sur and it was great. Let's aim for the first week of February. Jordan, can you look into availability at Post Ranch Inn or Ventana? Budget is $3K per person for the two-night stay.

Let me know if you have questions. Let's have a quick sync tomorrow at 10 AM to walk through the open items.

Priya

Priya,

Happy New Year to you too. Thanks for the recap.

I've already started pulling the vendor renewal data from the procurement system. I have 43 of the 47 contracts mapped to renewal dates — the remaining 4 are legacy agreements that don't have structured renewal terms in the system. I'll chase those down this week.

Quick question on the AWS renewal: we locked in the 3-year commitment last week at the 8% discount. Should I count that as done or do we need formal sign-off from the board given it exceeds the $4M threshold? The total commitment value is approximately $11.3M over 3 years.

On the offsite — Post Ranch has availability Feb 3-5. Ventana is fully booked that week but has Feb 10-12 open. Let me know your preference and I'll hold the rooms.

I'll have the full vendor renewal schedule ready by the 17th.

Jordan

Jordan,

Good catch on the AWS threshold. The board pre-authorized all infrastructure commitments within the approved capex budget at this morning's meeting, so we're covered. Mark it as approved. Please file the board authorization reference (Resolution 2025-001) in the contract file.

For the 4 legacy contracts — if they're under $50K annual, let's just bring them into the standard renewal template at their next renewal date. If any are over $50K, flag them for me and I'll work with Rachel's team on structuring proper MSAs.

Let's go with Post Ranch Feb 3-5. Book it.

Priya

Priya,

I spoke with our E&Y partner, Samantha Reeves, this morning. They've confirmed the March 3-21 audit window. Their team will be on-site the first week (March 3-7) for walkthroughs and testing, then remote for the remainder.

I've verified that all Q4 revenue recognition is complete. We had two items that required judgment calls — a multi-year prepaid deal with TransGlobal Shipping and a usage-based component for FreshTrack Logistics. Both have been documented per ASC 606 and reviewed by Samantha's team in their pre-audit call last month. I have the memo files ready for the PBC list.

I'm preparing the PBC (Prepared by Client) list and will have it distributed to all department leads by January 20 with responses due February 14. The PBC includes 87 items this year, up from 72 last year due to the expanded scope Mr. Kessler mentioned.

The UK subsidiary intercompany recon is in progress — I expect to close it out by end of this week. The only open item is a $47K timing difference on a cross-border software license payment that straddled the quarter end. It's straightforward but needs documentation.

Angela

Priya,

I'll have the revenue waterfall draft ready by the 13th. Quick initial cut: to get from $118.7M to $142M, we need roughly $28M in net new ARR, assuming approximately $5M in gross churn. That implies about $33M in gross new business (new logos plus expansion) offset by churn.

Based on Kevin's pipeline numbers and our historical conversion rates, I'm modeling:
  - New logo ARR: ~$19M (50+ logos at ~$380K blended ACV)
  - Expansion ARR: ~$14M (based on 119% NRR applied to expanding cohorts)
  - Gross churn: ~$5M (6% gross on the ~$80M expansion-eligible base)
  - Net new ARR: ~$28M

I'll layer in the quarterly phasing based on last year's seasonality patterns. Q1 is typically our softest quarter (approximately 18% of annual bookings), so I'll weight accordingly. Q4 is usually the strongest at about 32%, with Q2 and Q3 splitting the remainder roughly evenly.

I'm also building a sensitivity analysis showing the impact of plus or minus 5% on each variable. I'll include scenarios for faster-than-expected churn and slower-than-expected new logo acquisition so we have the board package ready for the February meeting.

One question: should I model the Axion Labs partnership impact separately? Hannah mentioned it in the product roadmap and it could drive incremental expansion revenue if it lands. I don't want to bake it into the base case but could show it as an upside scenario.

[09:03 AM] marcus.webb
@channel Happy new year team! Sprint 1 kicks off today. We have 14 stories in the backlog, 340 story points. Let's ship :rocket:

[09:04 AM] marcus.webb
Quick housekeeping: please make sure all your PRs from the holiday freeze are rebased and CI is green before you start pulling new work. We had 23 open pull requests as of this morning — let's get that number down by EOD. Anything that's been open since before the holiday freeze needs to be either merged or closed today.

[09:06 AM] lisa.chen
Morning everyone! Sharing platform team OKRs for Q1:

OKR 1: Complete migration to Kubernetes 1.29 for all production workloads (KR: 100% of services running on K8s by March 31)
OKR 2: Reduce p99 latency to <300ms under peak load (KR: measured via Datadog synthetics)
OKR 3: Achieve 99.99% uptime for core API endpoints (KR: calculated excluding planned maintenance windows)

If your team depends on the platform team for anything in Q1, please reach out to me by EOW so I can plan capacity accordingly. I have 18 engineers on the platform team and capacity is tight given the migration timeline.

[09:08 AM] raj.patel
@lisa.chen quick q — does the K8s 1.29 migration affect the rec engine v3 deployment? We're tracking for Feb 14 GA and I want to make sure we're not stepping on each other.

[09:10 AM] lisa.chen
@raj.patel Good question. We're planning production migration for Feb 3-7. Your Feb 14 release should be fine — you'd be deploying onto the new K8s cluster. Let's sync this week to make sure your Helm charts are compatible with 1.29. Minor changes expected — mostly around resource limit syntax and the new pod disruption budget API.

[09:12 AM] raj.patel
rec engine v3 GA is tracking for Feb 14 release. We're at 94% test coverage, just need to close out the edge cases on sparse matrix handling — @raj.patel

Specifically, we have 6 remaining test scenarios for the sparse matrix decomposition path. Four of them are around handling matrices with >95% sparsity, and two are edge cases with non-standard dimension ratios. I've assigned them to the team for this sprint.

[09:14 AM] sami.okoro
New on-call rotation posted. Please swap directly with teammates if you have conflicts. No need to loop me in unless it's more than 2 days.

Link: [On-Call Rotation Q1 2025](https://wiki.nextera.io/eng/oncall-q1-2025)

[09:15 AM] sami.okoro
Also — reminder that on-call handoff is now at 10 AM Pacific instead of 9 AM. We made this change based on the retro feedback last quarter where the London team was getting paged at 5 AM their time during the overlap period. Please update your PagerDuty schedules accordingly.

[09:17 AM] diana.xu
Is anyone else seeing flaky tests in the supply-chain-analytics module? I've had 3 tests fail intermittently this morning that were green on Friday. All three are in the test_logistics_aggregation suite.

[09:18 AM] raj.patel
@diana.xu Which tests? The ones that hit the external logistics API mock sometimes time out if the mock server hasn't warmed up. Try adding a 2s sleep before the assertion. I know it's ugly but it's a known issue — there's a ticket for it (ENG-4891).

[09:20 AM] diana.xu
@raj.patel Yep, that's exactly it. tests 47, 52, and 61 in the aggregation suite. Thanks Raj. I'll add the workaround and reference the ticket. Is anyone actively working on ENG-4891 or should I pick it up?

[09:21 AM] raj.patel
@diana.xu Nobody's assigned. If you have bandwidth this sprint, go for it. The fix is probably to use a readiness probe on the mock server instead of the sleep hack. Should be about 2 story points.

[09:22 AM] marcus.webb
Team metrics for reference:
- Engineering headcount: 142 (of 402 total company)
- Sprint 1 duration: Jan 6 - Jan 17 (2 weeks)
- Open pull requests: 23
- CI/CD pipeline pass rate last quarter: 97.2%
- Target CI pass rate this quarter: 98.5%
- Kubernetes migration target: complete by end of Q1

Remember: if CI is red for more than 30 minutes, the responsible engineer should revert or fix. No exceptions. Let's keep the pipeline green.

[09:25 AM] lisa.chen
One more thing — I'll be sending weekly migration status updates every Monday starting next week. If your service is on the migration list and you haven't reviewed the compatibility checklist, please do that this week. Link: [K8s 1.29 Compatibility Checklist](https://wiki.nextera.io/eng/k8s-compat-129)

We have 47 microservices to migrate, and I've grouped them into three waves:
- Wave 1 (Jan 13-17): 12 stateless API services
- Wave 2 (Jan 27-31): 18 worker/queue services
- Wave 3 (Feb 3-7): 17 stateful services (databases, caches, rec engine)

Please check which wave your service falls into and make sure your team has reviewed the compatibility checklist before your wave starts.

[09:27 AM] tommy.nakamura
@marcus.webb quick process question — for sprint 1, are we doing daily standups at 9:15 or 9:30? The calendar invite says 9:15 but the wiki says 9:30.

[09:28 AM] marcus.webb
@tommy.nakamura Good catch, it's 9:15 AM. I'll fix the wiki. We moved it up last quarter so it doesn't conflict with the West Coast product sync at 10.

[09:30 AM] elena.kowalski
Morning all! Just a heads up from the QA side — we're rolling out a new automated regression suite for the analytics pipeline this sprint. It adds about 450 new test cases. Expect the CI run time to increase by about 8 minutes until we optimize the parallel execution. I'll send details to #engineering-ci later today.

[09:32 AM] sami.okoro
@elena.kowalski 8 minutes is a lot — is there a way to run those in a separate pipeline stage so they don't block the critical path? Our current CI takes about 12 minutes and adding 8 would put us at 20, which is way above our target.

[09:33 AM] elena.kowalski
@sami.okoro Working on it! The plan is to run them in a parallel pipeline by sprint 2. For this sprint we'll run them serial to validate coverage before we optimize. Once we have confidence in the test stability, we can shard them across 4 runners and get back under 15 minutes total.

[09:35 AM] marcus.webb
Sounds good, Elena. Let's prioritize that optimization in sprint 2. Our target is to keep CI under 15 minutes end to end. I don't want us regressing on developer experience.

[09:37 AM] raj.patel
FYI — I'm going to be running some load tests on the rec engine v3 staging instance this afternoon between 2-5 PM Pacific. If you see elevated traffic in Datadog for the staging cluster, that's me. No action needed. I'll be ramping up to about 10x normal traffic to stress test the new sparse matrix paths.

[09:38 AM] lisa.chen
@raj.patel Roger that. I'll set up a Datadog annotation so the on-call doesn't page on it. Can you also drop a note in #engineering-incidents when you start and stop? Just so there's a record.

[09:39 AM] raj.patel
@lisa.chen Will do :thumbsup:

[09:42 AM] chris.malone
PSA: the new code review guidelines are live in Confluence. Key changes from last quarter: (1) all PRs need at least 2 approvals for production services, (2) security-tagged PRs need a review from someone on Frank's security team, (3) we're now using conventional commit messages. See ENG-POLICY-2025-01 for details.

[09:44 AM] sami.okoro
@chris.malone Thanks for the reminder. Team — please read the new guidelines before you submit your first PR this sprint. The conventional commit message format is required starting today.
