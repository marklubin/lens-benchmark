MEMORANDUM

TO:       Rachel Dominguez, General Counsel
FROM:     Nathan Foley, Senior Corporate Counsel
DATE:     February 8, 2025
RE:       Severance Policy Restructuring — Non-Executive Employees

I. PURPOSE

Per your direction, I have prepared a restructuring proposal for the non-executive severance policy. This memorandum outlines the current policy, the proposed modifications, the estimated financial impact, the benchmarking data, and the recommended implementation timeline.

II. CURRENT POLICY

Nextera Solutions currently maintains a severance program for all employees with two or more years of continuous service. The relevant terms for non-executive employees are as follows:

- Severance Multiplier: 2x base salary
- Trigger: Involuntary termination without cause
- Eligibility: Employees with 2+ years continuous tenure at date of separation
- Additional Benefits: COBRA coverage for 12 months, outplacement services for 6 months
- Vesting: All unvested equity accelerates pro-rata (separate policy — see equity acceleration memo)
- Non-Compete: 12-month non-compete and non-solicitation agreement

The 2x base salary multiplier was established in 2019 when the company was competing aggressively for talent in a tight labor market. At that time, the 2x multiplier positioned Nextera in the 75th percentile of its compensation peer group, which was a deliberate strategy to attract and retain senior individual contributors and mid-level managers.

III. PROPOSED MODIFICATION

Current severance multiplier for non-executives with 2+ years tenure: 2x base salary. Proposed: 1x base salary. This aligns with the lower quartile of our peer group per the Compensia survey.

The modification applies solely to the base salary multiplier for involuntary terminations. The following elements of the current policy would remain unchanged:

- Eligibility threshold: 2+ years continuous tenure (no change)
- COBRA coverage: 12 months (no change)
- Outplacement services: 6 months (no change)
- Non-compete and non-solicitation: 12 months (no change)
- Executive severance: governed by separate executive employment agreements (not affected by this proposal)

The reduced multiplier applies only to involuntary terminations. We recommend the change be effective March 1, concurrent with the equity acceleration policy update.

IV. FINANCIAL IMPACT

The financial impact of this restructuring is as follows:

Employee Population:
- Total non-executive employees with 2+ years tenure: approximately 388
- Average base salary for this cohort: $92,700

Current Estimated Liability:
- 388 employees x $92,700 average base x 2.0 multiplier = approximately $71.9M gross
- Adjusted for probability weighting (50% involuntary separation assumption per industry standard): approximately $36M
- This restructuring reduces total estimated non-executive severance liability from approximately $36M to $18M.

Proposed Estimated Liability:
- 388 employees x $92,700 average base x 1.0 multiplier = approximately $36.0M gross
- Adjusted for probability weighting: approximately $18M

Net Liability Reduction: approximately $18M

The $18M reduction represents the aggregate cost exposure in a qualifying event scenario. I want to be precise about the framing: this is the estimated exposure reduction under our current probability-weighted model, not a cash savings in the ordinary course. The liability reduction is relevant in the context of corporate events that trigger involuntary separations.

V. PEER GROUP BENCHMARKING

We commissioned a review from Compensia (our external compensation consultant) as part of the 2024 annual review cycle. The relevant findings for non-executive severance multipliers among our peer group (enterprise SaaS companies with $200M-$500M revenue) are:

- 25th percentile: 1.0x base salary
- 50th percentile (median): 1.5x base salary
- 75th percentile: 2.0x base salary

Our current 2.0x multiplier is at the 75th percentile. The proposed 1.0x multiplier would position us at the 25th percentile.

The following table provides specific comparisons to named peers (all data from Compensia 2024 survey and publicly available proxy statements):

| Company | Revenue Range | Non-Exec Severance Multiplier |
|---------|--------------|-------------------------------|
| Kinaxis | $300-350M | 1.0x |
| Coupa Software | $250-300M | 1.5x |
| E2open | $200-250M | 1.0x |
| project44 | $150-200M | 1.5x |
| FourKites | $100-150M | 1.0x |
| Descartes Systems | $400-450M | 2.0x |
| Manhattan Associates | $750-800M | 1.5x |

Among our seven named peers, three maintain a 1.0x multiplier, three maintain a 1.5x multiplier, and one maintains a 2.0x multiplier. The proposed 1.0x multiplier is consistent with the approach taken by Kinaxis, E2open, and FourKites.

VI. LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS

A. ERISA Implications

The severance program is classified as an ERISA welfare benefit plan. Modifications to the plan require compliance with ERISA Section 402(b)(3) regarding the amendment procedure specified in the plan document. Our current plan document reserves the right of the Board of Directors to amend or terminate the plan at any time, subject to the following conditions:

1. No reduction in benefits for employees who have already received a notice of involuntary termination.
2. Written notice to affected employees at least 30 days prior to the effective date.
3. Approval by the Board of Directors.

All three conditions can be satisfied with the proposed March 1 effective date, provided the Board approves at the February 10 meeting and employee notice is distributed no later than February 10.

B. California WARN Act

The severance restructuring itself does not trigger California WARN Act obligations. However, if a future reduction in force affects 50 or more employees within a 30-day period, the standard WARN notice requirements (60 days) would apply regardless of the severance multiplier.

C. Change-in-Control Provisions

The current severance policy contains a change-in-control provision that provides a 2.5x multiplier (rather than the standard 2.0x) in the event of a qualifying termination within 18 months of a change-in-control transaction. This provision is contained in a separate section of the plan document and is not affected by the proposed amendment to the standard multiplier.

However, I recommend that we separately review the change-in-control provision for consistency. If the standard multiplier is reduced to 1.0x, the change-in-control multiplier of 2.5x represents a 2.5x step-up, which is above the 75th percentile for change-in-control severance in our peer group (75th percentile = 2.0x step-up). This is a separate analysis and can be addressed in a subsequent memo.

D. Communication Strategy

I recommend that the employee communication be crafted carefully to present the change as a market alignment. The key messages should be:

1. The 2.0x multiplier was established in 2019 in a different market environment.
2. The company regularly benchmarks its compensation and benefits against peers.
3. The new 1.0x multiplier is consistent with market norms.
4. All other severance benefits remain unchanged (COBRA, outplacement, non-compete terms).

The communication should avoid language that could be construed as an admission that the prior policy was excessive or that the change is motivated by a specific transaction or event. I recommend routing the final communication through Legal for review before distribution.

VII. IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE

| Date | Action |
|------|--------|
| Feb 8 | Legal memo circulated to General Counsel |
| Feb 10 | Board of Directors approval (regular meeting agenda item) |
| Feb 10 | Employee notice distributed (30-day advance notice) |
| Feb 14 | FAQ document published to HR portal |
| Feb 21 | HR town hall — open Q&A session for employees |
| Mar 1 | New severance multiplier effective |
| Mar 1 | Equity acceleration policy update effective (concurrent) |

VIII. RECOMMENDATION

I recommend that this restructuring proposal be presented to the Board of Directors for approval at the February 10 meeting. Board approval is required: yes, at February 10 meeting. The proposal should be presented as Agenda Item 7 (Compensation Committee Report) and will require a simple majority vote.

Upon board approval, I will prepare the formal plan amendment and the employee notice letter for General Counsel's signature. The employee notice will be distributed via company email and posted on the HR portal by 5:00 PM on February 10.

Please let me know if you would like me to modify any aspect of this proposal before presentation to the Board.

Respectfully submitted,

Nathan Foley
Senior Corporate Counsel
Nextera Solutions, Inc.

| 10+ years | 8 | $118,900 | $1,902,400 | $951,200 |
| TOTAL | 388 | $92,700 | $72,389,600 | $36,194,800 |

Probability-weighted: $36M (current) → $18M (proposed)

Note: These calculations are based on current headcount and compensation data. Actual liability at any future point will depend on the then-current employee population.

APPENDIX B: COMPENSIA SURVEY METHODOLOGY

Compensia conducted its 2024 Enterprise SaaS Compensation Survey during Q3-Q4 2024, covering 127 companies in the enterprise SaaS sector with revenues between $100M and $1B. The survey collected data on:

- Base salary ranges by role and level
- Variable compensation structures
- Equity grant practices
- Severance and change-in-control provisions
- Board compensation
- Executive employment agreement terms

All data was collected on a confidential basis and aggregated by revenue band. Nextera's peer group consists of companies with $200M-$500M in annual revenue (n=34). The percentile rankings cited in this memo are specific to that revenue band.

[9:00 AM] @marcus_webb
Good morning team. Big day — hackathon demos start at 10 AM in the main auditorium. 23 teams presenting. Grab coffee and head over.

[9:01 AM] @sami_okoro
Can't wait to see what everyone built. My team is presenting second — we built a container cost anomaly detector. Not as flashy as some others but could save real money.

[9:02 AM] @derek_powell
23 teams! That's huge. Last hackathon was only 14 teams.

[9:03 AM] @marcus_webb
92 participants across 23 teams. Biggest hackathon in company history. I'm genuinely impressed by the turnout.

[9:05 AM] @emily_watson
Are the demos streamed for remote folks?

[9:06 AM] @marcus_webb
Yes — Zoom link in the #hackathon channel. Recording will be posted to Confluence by Monday.

[9:07 AM] @kevin_lo
Can judges ask questions during the demo or only at the end?

[9:08 AM] @sami_okoro
Questions at the end. Each team gets 5 minutes to present + 3 minutes Q&A.

[9:09 AM] @priya_nair
That's almost 3 hours of demos :scream:

[9:10 AM] @marcus_webb
We'll take a 15-minute break after team 12. Snacks provided.

Team members: Yuki Tanaka, Alex Reeves, Priya Nair, Jordan Liu
Prize: $5,000 team award + fast-track product evaluation

:second_place_medal: SECOND PLACE
Team 'AutoDoc' — automated API documentation generator. Reads code, generates OpenAPI specs and human-readable docs. Judges loved the live demo.

Team members: Omar Hassan, Lisa Martinez, Chris Park
Prize: $2,500 team award

:third_place_medal: THIRD PLACE
Team 'CostHound' — container cost anomaly detector (Sami's team!)
Monitors K8s resource usage, identifies over-provisioned pods, recommends right-sizing.

[1:16 PM] @priya_nair
WE WON?!?! :tada: :tada: :tada:

[1:17 PM] @kevin_lo
Congrats @priya_nair and team ChainWhisperer! That demo was amazing. The part where you asked "what's the average delivery time from our Southeast Asian suppliers" and it parsed the query and pulled live data was :fire:

[1:18 PM] @yuki_tanaka
Thank you!! The whole team worked so hard on this. We had to build a custom query parser and wire it into the logistics data lake. Sleep was optional this week :sleeping:

[1:19 PM] @derek_powell
Fast-track product evaluation — that means this could actually ship?

[1:20 PM] @marcus_webb
Potentially. Product team will evaluate the technical feasibility and market fit. If it passes their review, it goes into the roadmap discussion for Q3. No guarantees but the judges were very enthusiastic.

[1:22 PM] @sami_okoro
Third place! I'll take it. And honestly CostHound is going to save us real money. We already identified $12K/month in over-provisioned pods during the hackathon build.

[1:23 PM] @lisa_chen_platform
@sami_okoro that $12K/month finding is legit. Let's talk about integrating CostHound into our monitoring stack. After the K8s migration savings we're already tracking, this would be the cherry on top.

[1:24 PM] @sami_okoro
@lisa_chen_platform absolutely. I'll set up a meeting next week.

Switching gears to launch prep. rec engine v3 final QA: 2,341 unit tests passing, 847 integration tests passing, 0 P1 bugs, 2 P3 cosmetic issues. WE ARE GO FOR LAUNCH :rocket:

[3:31 PM] @emily_watson
:clap: what are the P3 issues?

[3:32 PM] @james_tucker
1. Tooltip text on the recommendation card is truncated at 120 chars instead of 150. CSS fix, but non-blocking.
2. The "Why this recommendation" modal has a slight alignment issue on mobile Safari. Also non-blocking.

Both are tagged for post-launch cleanup.

[3:33 PM] @emily_watson
Makes sense. Those can wait.

[3:34 PM] @derek_powell
What's the final performance benchmark?

[3:35 PM] @james_tucker
v3 performance vs v2:
- Recommendation latency: 45ms → 32ms (29% improvement)
- Click-through rate (staging A/B): 3.2% → 4.1% (28% improvement)
- Model training time: 4.2hrs → 2.8hrs (33% improvement)
- Memory footprint: 12GB → 8.4GB (30% reduction)

All metrics are improvements. The ML team did outstanding work on model optimization.

[3:37 PM] @marcus_webb
Those numbers are excellent. @james_tucker please make sure these are captured in the launch announcement. David will want to reference them.

[3:38 PM] @james_tucker
Already in the launch doc. Will send a summary to David's office by Monday.

[3:40 PM] @kevin_lo
launch party February 14! yes it's Valentine's Day. yes there will be heart-shaped cookies :heart:

[3:41 PM] @rachel_santos
I'm handling the party logistics. Main auditorium, 4:00 PM. Catering order submitted. We've got cookies, cupcakes, and a build-your-own taco bar.

[3:42 PM] @derek_powell
taco bar AND cookies? Best launch party ever.

[3:43 PM] @priya_nair
Can we get a cake that says "rec engine v3" on it?

[3:44 PM] @rachel_santos
Already ordered. It says "We Recommend v3" with a rocket emoji. Yes, in frosting.

[3:45 PM] @emily_watson
:joy: perfect.

[4:15 PM] @amit_shah
Random question — anyone else notice the parking garage lights on Level 2 have been flickering?

[4:16 PM] @derek_powell
Yeah I noticed that yesterday. I think facilities has it on the list for this weekend.

[4:17 PM] @amit_shah
Cool. It's a little creepy in the dark. Also the west stairwell door on floor 3 has been sticking again.

[4:18 PM] @rachel_santos
Submitted a facilities ticket for both. The Level 2 lights are scheduled for replacement this Saturday. The stairwell door needs a hinge adjustment — maintenance will look at it Monday.

[4:19 PM] @amit_shah

[4:45 PM] @sami_okoro
Quick PSA — if you're using the new CI pipeline config that was rolled out Thursday, make sure to update your `.ci.yaml` template. The old syntax for artifact publishing is deprecated and will stop working March 1.

[4:46 PM] @kevin_lo
Is there a migration guide?

[4:47 PM] @sami_okoro
Yes, it's in Confluence under DevOps > CI Pipeline > Migration Guide v2.4. Main change is the artifact block moved from `publish:` to `artifacts:outputs:`. Takes about 2 minutes to update per project.

[4:48 PM] @kevin_lo
Got it. I'll update my repos on Monday.

To: Executive Team <exec-team@nexterasolutions.com>
Subject: Q1 Customer Health Report — Mid-Quarter

Team,

Here is the mid-quarter customer health update for Q1 2025. Summary up top, details below.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Mid-quarter health update: 73% green, 20% yellow, 7% red. Improving from January.

We are tracking 142 active enterprise accounts with a combined ARR of $48.3M. The health distribution has improved from January (which was 68% green / 23% yellow / 9% red) due to successful implementations and two strategic renewals.

BIG WINS

Big wins: Freight Corp went live on Feb 7 — smooth deployment after the earlier delays. GlobalShip signed a 3-year renewal at $890K.

1. Freight Corp Implementation (ACV: $320K)
Freight Corp went live on February 7 after a 14-week implementation cycle. The original timeline was 10 weeks, but integration complexity with their legacy ERP system added 4 weeks. Despite the delay, the customer is satisfied with the outcome. 120 users onboarded as of go-live. Their VP of Operations sent a note to our implementation team saying "this is the smoothest enterprise deployment we've experienced in years." Post-launch support transition is scheduled for February 15.

2. GlobalShip Partners Renewal (ACV: $890K, 3-year term)
GlobalShip signed a 3-year renewal at $890K on February 6. This is a 12% increase from their prior contract ($795K). The renewal includes an expanded license for their Asia-Pacific operations (4 additional distribution centers). GlobalShip has been a customer since 2021 and is one of our most vocal champions — their CTO presented at our user conference last year.

AT-RISK ACCOUNTS

Two enterprise accounts running competitive RFPs: TransGlobal Logistics and Pacific Freight. Both are evaluating Kinaxis. We need product marketing support on battle cards.

1. TransGlobal Logistics (ACV: $180K, renewal date: April 30)
TransGlobal has been a customer since 2022. Their new VP of Supply Chain joined in November and is running a comprehensive vendor evaluation. They've issued an RFP that includes Kinaxis, E2open, and us. Our QBR with them on January 28 went well, but the new VP wants to benchmark against the market.

Action items:
- Product marketing: update Kinaxis battle card with latest competitive intel (due Feb 14)
- Account team: schedule executive sponsor meeting with their CTO (targeting week of Feb 17)
- Solutions engineering: prepare custom demo tailored to their distribution network topology

2. Pacific Freight (ACV: $145K, renewal date: May 15)
Pacific Freight has expressed dissatisfaction with our reporting module. They feel the dashboard customization options are limited compared to Kinaxis's offering. They've started a formal RFP process.

Action items:
- Product team: prioritize dashboard customization roadmap brief (due Feb 12)
- Account team: offer Pacific Freight early access to the reporting module refresh (Q2 roadmap item)
- CS team: assign dedicated CSM for weekly check-ins through renewal period

DETAILED METRICS

| Metric | Current | January | Q4 Avg |
|--------|---------|---------|--------|
| Green (healthy) | 73% | 68% | 71% |
| Yellow (monitor) | 20% | 23% | 21% |
| Red (at-risk) | 7% | 9% | 8% |
| NPS (last survey) | 42 | 42 | 39 |
| Gross Retention | 94.2% | 93.8% | 93.5% |
| Net Retention | 108.3% | 107.1% | 106.8% |

QUARTERLY BUSINESS REVIEWS (QBRs)

QBRs completed: 18 of 42 scheduled. We are on track to complete all QBRs by the end of Q1. The remaining 24 are scheduled between February 10 and March 28. No scheduling issues anticipated.

QBR Insights (from completed reviews):
- Top positive theme: Platform reliability improvements (mentioned by 14 of 18 accounts)
- Top request: Enhanced reporting and dashboard customization (mentioned by 11 of 18 accounts)
- Top concern: Pricing (mentioned by 7 of 18 accounts — all tied to upcoming renewals)
- Feature request frequency: API improvements (9), mobile app (8), custom reporting (7), alerting enhancements (5)

NPS SURVEY

NPS survey launching February 15. This will be distributed to all active accounts (primary contacts + power users, approximately 2,100 recipients). Survey will remain open through March 1. Results expected by March 7.

Prior NPS scores:
- Q1 2024: 36
- Q2 2024: 38
- Q3 2024: 41
- Q4 2024: 39
- Q1 2025 mid-quarter pulse: 42

The upward trend in NPS is encouraging. Our target for the full Q1 survey is 43+.

SUPPORT METRICS

| Metric | January | February (MTD) |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| Total tickets | 847 | 312 |
| Avg first response time | 2.1 hrs | 1.8 hrs |
| Avg resolution time | 14.2 hrs | 12.7 hrs |
| P1 tickets | 3 | 0 |
| P2 tickets | 18 | 7 |
| CSAT (support) | 4.4/5.0 | 4.5/5.0 |

Support performance is strong. The improvement in first response time is driven by the new triage automation we rolled out in January.

UPCOMING MILESTONES

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| Feb 14 | Rec engine v3 launch — customer-facing impact |
| Feb 15 | Freight Corp post-launch support transition |
| Feb 15 | NPS survey launch |
| Feb 17 | TransGlobal exec sponsor meeting (targeting) |
| Feb 28 | Axion integration sprint complete |
| Mar 1 | NPS survey close |
| Mar 7 | NPS results published |
| Mar 28 | All Q1 QBRs completed |

TEAM UPDATE

Customer Success team is currently at 18 headcount (target: 20). We have two open CSM positions posted — one for the Pacific Northwest territory and one for the Southeast region. Interviews are in progress for both roles; we expect to extend offers by February 21.

The team completed our annual CSM certification program last month. All 18 CSMs are now certified on the updated platform features including the Axion integration capabilities (preview). This positions us well for customer conversations about the partnership.

BUDGET

CS team Q1 budget utilization: 38% ($228K of $600K). On track for full-year budget. Major upcoming expenses: NPS survey platform renewal ($18K in March), customer advisory board event ($45K in April).

REQUEST

I need two things from this group:

1. Product marketing: updated Kinaxis battle cards. This is time-sensitive given the TransGlobal and Pacific Freight RFPs. Target delivery: February 14.

2. Product team: dashboard customization roadmap brief. Pacific Freight specifically cited this as a competitive gap. Target delivery: February 12.

Happy to discuss any of this in our Wednesday exec meeting.

Best,
Amanda Briggs
VP, Customer Success

Subject: RE: Q1 Customer Health Report — Mid-Quarter

Amanda,

Good report. A few comments:

1. GlobalShip renewal at $890K/3yr is excellent. Nice work by the account team. Let's make sure we publicly recognize them at the next all-hands.

2. On TransGlobal and Pacific Freight — I agree these need immediate attention. Let's discuss a coordinated response in Wednesday's exec meeting. I may want to make personal calls to both accounts if the situation warrants it.

3. The Kinaxis competition is real. We've seen them more frequently in the last two quarters. I've asked the competitive intel team to prepare a comprehensive Kinaxis analysis — strengths, weaknesses, pricing, win/loss data. That should be ready by mid-February and will complement the battle cards.

4. Net retention at 108.3% is solid. Let's see if we can push that above 110% by end of Q1 with the GlobalShip expansion and any upsell opportunities in the QBR pipeline.

Thanks,
David

Subject: RE: Q1 Customer Health Report — Mid-Quarter

Amanda,

Two things from engineering's side:

1. The dashboard customization roadmap brief — I've already flagged this with the product team. We have a reporting module refresh planned for Q2 that addresses most of the customization requests we've been hearing. I'll make sure the brief highlights the specific features that address Pacific Freight's concerns.

2. On the API improvements request from QBRs — we shipped a new REST API versioning scheme in January (v3 API). If customers haven't been briefed on it, we should include it in the remaining QBR discussions. It addresses the top three API-related feature requests from last year.

I'll coordinate with James Tucker on the rec engine v3 customer-facing launch communication. We want to make sure customers know about the performance improvements — the 29% latency reduction and improved recommendations could be a strong retention talking point.

David, Marcus,

Thank you both.

David — I agree on recognizing the GlobalShip account team. I'll prepare a brief for the all-hands. On the executive calls to TransGlobal and Pacific Freight, let me get the latest temperature from the account teams first and I'll brief you before Wednesday.

Marcus — great to hear about the reporting module refresh. That's exactly what we need for the Pacific Freight conversation. And yes, the v3 API briefing should definitely be part of remaining QBRs. I'll have my team coordinate with James on timing to avoid information overload on customers (rec engine v3 launch + API update + NPS survey all hitting around the same time).

I'll prepare a consolidated action plan for Wednesday's meeting.
