Subject: Board Resignation — Effective Immediately

Dear Robert,

I am resigning from the Board of Directors of Nextera Solutions effective immediately. I have fundamental strategic disagreements with the current direction of the board that I cannot reconcile with my fiduciary obligations.

I have made my position clear in multiple board sessions and do not believe the board's current course serves the long-term interests of shareholders or employees.

This decision was not arrived at lightly. Since joining the board in January 2022, I have served with the utmost commitment to Nextera's mission and its stakeholders. I held seats on both the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee, and I am proud of the work accomplished during my tenure. However, the circumstances have reached a point where my continued participation is untenable.

I am declining the standard 90-day transition period. My resignation is effective upon your receipt of this email. I have already coordinated with my assistant to return all board materials, company-issued devices, and secure access credentials. My badge and laptop will be couriered to Maria Fuentes's office by end of business today.

I recognize that my departure will reduce the board to four members — yourself, Patricia Whitfield, Vikram Patel, and David Aldric. I trust the board will undertake a timely search for a replacement independent director and ensure that the Audit Committee and Compensation Committee maintain their required composition.

I wish the company and its employees well.

Sincerely,
Sarah Jiang

Sarah,

I am sorry to see you go. Your contributions have been valuable. I respect your decision and wish you well.

I will convene a special session with the remaining directors to discuss the vacancy and our path forward. Maria — please begin the process for our SEC disclosure obligations.

Robert,

Acknowledged. I am preparing the 8-K filing draft for SEC disclosure now. Under SEC rules we are required to file the 8-K within four business days of the resignation, which gives us a deadline of Tuesday, February 11, 2025.

The draft will include the standard disclosures required under Item 5.02 regarding the departure of a director. I will circulate the draft for your review and David's review no later than 3:00 PM today so we can file promptly.

Please confirm whether you would like to include any additional context in the filing beyond the standard language, or if you prefer to keep it to the minimum required disclosure.

Separately, I will update our corporate governance records to reflect the board composition change and will notify the chairs of the Audit Committee and Compensation Committee regarding the vacancy on their respective committees.

Regards,
Maria Fuentes
Corporate Secretary

Robert,

Current committee composition following Ms. Jiang's departure:

AUDIT COMMITTEE
- Patricia Whitfield (Chair)
- Vikram Patel
- [Vacancy — formerly Sarah Jiang]

The Audit Committee requires a minimum of three independent directors under our charter. With only two remaining members, we will need to appoint a replacement promptly or amend the charter.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE
- Vikram Patel (Chair)
- Robert Kessler
- [Vacancy — formerly Sarah Jiang]

Same situation — charter requires three members. We are technically non-compliant as of today.

GOVERNANCE AND NOMINATING COMMITTEE
- Robert Kessler (Chair)
- Patricia Whitfield
- Vikram Patel

No impact from Ms. Jiang's departure as she did not serve on this committee.

I will include a note about the committee vacancies in my materials for the special session.

Regards,
Maria

Maria,

Thank you for the committee breakdown. This is helpful. Let's schedule the special session for Thursday, February 6 at 8:00 AM PST. Please distribute the 8-K draft along with the committee composition memo in advance.

I will also want to discuss the director search process. Please prepare a summary of the qualifications we outlined in the last governance review — I believe we identified experience in enterprise SaaS, public company board service, and data analytics as the top priorities.

Robert,

I have reviewed the thread. I agree with keeping the 8-K to minimum required disclosure. I will attend the special session Thursday morning.

On the committee vacancies — I believe Patricia may have some suggestions for candidates. I spoke with her briefly this morning and she mentioned she had been maintaining a rolling list of potential board candidates.

We should also consult outside counsel on the timeline for remedying the Audit Committee non-compliance. I believe there is a cure period under the exchange listing standards, but I want to confirm the specifics.

[9:12 AM] @rachel_santos
Axion team is in the building! 4 of their engineers are here this week for integration onboarding. Welcome @axion-team :wave:

[9:13 AM] @derek_powell
Nice! Which floor are they on?

[9:14 AM] @rachel_santos
4th floor, war room B. They'll be there through Friday. 2 backend engineers, 1 data engineer, and 1 PM. Stop by and say hi if you get a chance.

[9:15 AM] @amit_shah
@rachel_santos do they have badge access or do they need escorts?

[9:16 AM] @rachel_santos
They have temporary visitor badges. Good for floors 1-4 only. Server room and exec floor require escort. Facilities already set them up with WiFi credentials on the guest network.

[9:18 AM] @derek_powell
cool. is there a kickoff meeting?

[9:19 AM] @rachel_santos
Already happened! We had the integration sprint kickoff at 8:30 this morning. Sprint runs Feb 3-28 (4 weeks). Integration team is 8 Nextera + 4 Axion. We're targeting the standard ingestion pipeline — Kafka topic is already provisioned.

[9:22 AM] @priya_nair
What's the Kafka topic name? I want to make sure our monitoring picks it up.

[9:23 AM] @rachel_santos
nextera.axion.logistics.raw — I submitted the monitoring config PR this morning. Should be merged by EOD.

[9:24 AM] @priya_nair
:thumbsup: I'll check the Grafana dashboard once it's up.

[9:27 AM] @kevin_lo
integration architecture looks clean — they're piping data through Kafka and we consume via our standard ingestion layer. no custom plumbing needed :thumbsup:

[9:28 AM] @rachel_santos
Exactly. That was the whole point of the architecture review last month — make sure we don't end up with one-off connectors. Standard ingestion, standard schema validation, standard error handling.

[9:30 AM] @kevin_lo
what about authentication? are they using our OAuth provider or do they have their own?

[9:31 AM] @rachel_santos
Our OAuth provider. They're registering as a service account under the partner tier. Same setup we used for the DataNova integration last year.

[9:33 AM] @amit_shah
speaking of DataNova — whatever happened to that integration? I haven't seen any traffic from them in months.

[9:34 AM] @rachel_santos
Good question. I think they pivoted their product and stopped sending data. @kevin_lo do you know?

[9:35 AM] @kevin_lo
yeah, DataNova sunset their logistics product in Q3 last year. The integration is still technically active but the Kafka topic hasn't had a message since September. We should probably decommission it.

[9:36 AM] @rachel_santos
Filed a ticket. Let's clean that up during the next infra sprint.

[10:45 AM] @james_tucker
Quick reminder: rec engine v3 launch in 9 days. feature freeze is in effect. bug fixes only from here.

[10:46 AM] @emily_watson
What's the launch date again?

[10:47 AM] @james_tucker
February 14. Feature freeze started today, Feb 5. Between now and launch it's bug fixes, performance testing, and documentation only.

[10:48 AM] @emily_watson
Got it. I have two PRs pending review — both are bug fixes for the ranking algorithm edge cases. Can those still go in?

[10:49 AM] @james_tucker
Yes, bug fixes are fine. Just tag them with the `v3-freeze` label so we can track what went in after freeze.

[10:51 AM] @derek_powell
are we still doing the beta rollout on Feb 10 or did that get pushed?

[10:52 AM] @james_tucker
Still Feb 10 for 5% traffic. Full rollout Feb 14 assuming no issues. We'll monitor error rates, latency, and conversion metrics during the beta window.

[10:54 AM] @priya_nair
Do we have a rollback plan?

[10:55 AM] @james_tucker
Yes. Feature flag kill switch. If we see error rates above 1% or p99 latency above 500ms, we flip the flag and route traffic back to v2. Documented in the launch runbook.

[10:57 AM] @emily_watson
:+1: good stuff. I'll get my PRs submitted today.

[11:30 AM] @derek_powell
Hey does anyone know what's going on with the elevators on the east side? Both out of service since yesterday.

[11:31 AM] @rachel_santos
Facilities posted an update in #facilities — apparently the control board failed. Repair tech coming tomorrow morning. Use the west elevators or the stairs until then.

[11:32 AM] @derek_powell
ugh. I'm on 6. That's a lot of stairs.

[11:33 AM] @kevin_lo
leg day every day :runner:

[2:15 PM] @amit_shah
Anyone else getting timeouts on the staging environment?

[2:16 PM] @kevin_lo
Yeah, staging has been flaky today. I think the K8s migration team is still running validation checks. Should clear up by EOD.

[2:17 AM] @lisa_chen_platform
Confirming — we completed the K8s 1.29 production migration early this morning and are running post-migration validation on staging. Should be stable by 4 PM.

[2:18 PM] @amit_shah
Cool, no rush. I'll switch to local dev for now.

[3:45 PM] @rachel_santos
Reminder: office social this Friday, Feb 7 at 5:30 PM in the 3rd floor lounge. Snacks and drinks provided. Axion team is invited too — good chance to mingle with the visiting engineers.

[3:46 PM] @priya_nair
Will there be vegetarian options?

[3:47 PM] @rachel_santos
Yes! I specifically requested a mix. Vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options available.

[3:48 PM] @james_tucker
I'll be there after the post-mortem wraps up. Should be around 5:45 or so.

[3:49 PM] @rachel_santos
:thumbsup: see you all there

[4:35 PM] @derek_powell
Did everyone see the email from David about the board change?

[4:36 PM] @kevin_lo
yeah, just saw it. Sarah Jiang stepped down apparently.

[4:37 PM] @emily_watson
Who is Sarah Jiang? I don't think I've ever interacted with any board members.

[4:38 PM] @derek_powell
She was one of the independent directors. Been on the board like 3 years I think. No idea what she actually did day-to-day from our perspective.

[4:39 PM] @kevin_lo
Board members don't really do day-to-day stuff. They show up for quarterly meetings, review financials, approve major decisions. That kind of thing.

[4:40 PM] @emily_watson
Gotcha. Does this affect us at all?

[4:41 PM] @derek_powell
Doubt it. These things happen. They'll find a replacement.

[4:42 PM] @priya_nair
The email said they're starting a search for a new director. Sounds routine.

[4:43 PM] @kevin_lo
yeah, back to work. rec engine v3 isn't going to test itself :sweat_smile:

INTERNAL COMMUNICATION

From: David Aldric, Chief Executive Officer
Date: Wednesday, February 5, 2025, 4:30 PM PST
To: All Employees
Subject: Board Update

Team,

I want to let you know that Sarah Jiang has stepped down from our Board of Directors to pursue other opportunities. We thank Sarah for her three years of service and wish her the best.

During her time on the board, Sarah served on both the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee, and her contributions to those committees are appreciated. She brought a strong analytical perspective and deep experience in enterprise technology that benefited the company during a period of growth.

The board will begin a search for a new independent director in the coming weeks. Our governance remains strong with four experienced directors guiding the company.

This is a natural part of board transitions, and I want to assure you that it does not change our strategic direction or operational plans. We remain focused on executing our product roadmap, strengthening our customer relationships, and growing the business.

Some logistical notes related to governance:

1. The Governance and Nominating Committee, chaired by Robert Kessler, will lead the director search process. If you have questions about how board searches work, our Corporate Secretary Maria Fuentes is happy to provide background.

2. We have filed the required SEC disclosure (Form 8-K) as of today, in compliance with our reporting obligations.

3. The remaining board members are: Robert Kessler (Chair), Patricia Whitfield, Vikram Patel, and myself. All four directors are fully engaged and committed to the company's success.

I know board-level changes can sometimes create uncertainty, but I want to be clear: our plans are unchanged. The Axion partnership integration is underway, recommendation engine v3 launches on February 14, and we continue to invest in the platform and team.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me or Maria Fuentes.

Thank you,
David Aldric
CEO, Nextera Solutions

Subject: K8s Migration Complete — Post-Mortem Scheduled

Marcus,

K8s 1.29 migration complete. Zero customer-facing downtime. p99 latency improved from 380ms to 290ms. Team executed flawlessly.

Here are the details:

MIGRATION SUMMARY
- Migration window: Feb 5, 02:00 AM - 05:47 AM PST (3 hours 47 minutes)
- Customer-facing downtime: 0 minutes
- Error rate during migration: 0.02% (threshold was 0.5%)
- Pre-migration p99 latency: 380ms
- Post-migration p99 latency: 290ms
- Rollback triggered: No

WHAT HAPPENED
We began the rolling update at 02:00 AM as planned. The migration proceeded pod-by-pod across our three production clusters (us-west-2, us-east-1, eu-west-1). Each cluster completed within approximately 75 minutes. The final cluster (eu-west-1) completed at 05:47 AM.

The low error rate (0.02%) consisted entirely of transient connection resets during pod restarts, all of which were automatically retried by client-side retry logic. No customer-visible errors were generated.

The p99 latency improvement from 380ms to 290ms is attributable to the improved scheduling algorithms in K8s 1.29 and our updated resource requests/limits, which we tuned during the staging rehearsal last week.

COST IMPACT
Cost savings tracking: early data shows 42% reduction in compute costs. We'll have a full month of data by March. The savings come from better bin-packing of pods, reduced over-provisioning, and the spot instance improvements in the new scheduler.

Preliminary numbers:
- Old infrastructure monthly compute: ~$187,000
- New infrastructure estimated monthly compute: ~$108,000
- Estimated monthly savings: ~$79,000

These are rough estimates based on 18 hours of data. I'll have a proper cost analysis with a full billing cycle by early March.

POST-MORTEM
Scheduling post-mortem for Friday Feb 7. Even though this went well, we should document what worked for future migrations. The post-mortem will be structured as a learning exercise, not a failure analysis.

Post-mortem details:
- Date: Friday, February 7, 2025
- Time: 10:00 AM PST
- Location: Conference Room 4A / Zoom link to follow
- Facilitator: Lisa Chen
- Attendees: Platform Team, SRE on-call, QA leads

AGENDA:
1. Timeline walkthrough (15 min)
2. What went well (15 min)
3. What we'd do differently (15 min)
4. Action items for DR migration in March (15 min)

DR MIGRATION
The disaster recovery site migration to K8s 1.29 is still on schedule for March. We'll use the learnings from this production migration to inform that process. The DR site is smaller (single cluster) so it should be straightforward, but I want to apply the same rigor.

Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like me to present the migration results at the next engineering leadership meeting.

Best,
Lisa

Subject: RE: K8s Migration Complete — Post-Mortem Scheduled

Lisa,

Outstanding work. Zero downtime and a latency improvement — that's the kind of migration result we want to see every time.

A few thoughts:

1. Yes, please present at the engineering leadership meeting. I'll add you to the agenda for next Wednesday (Feb 12). Prepare a 10-minute summary with the key metrics and the cost savings projection.

2. The 42% compute cost reduction is significant. Let's make sure we capture this properly for the quarterly business review. Can you work with finance to get the baseline costs validated? I don't want to over-promise on the savings before we have a full billing cycle.

3. On the DR migration — let's use the post-mortem output to create a proper runbook template. I'd like to standardize our migration playbook so we can hand it off to the team leads for future Kubernetes version upgrades.

4. The p99 latency improvement is a nice bonus. Do we have data on p50 and p95 as well? I'd like a full percentile breakdown for the leadership presentation.

5. Quick question on the error rate — 0.02% is great, but what's our baseline error rate outside of migrations? I want to contextualize the migration impact.

Great job to you and the entire platform team. This is the kind of disciplined execution that builds trust across the org.

Subject: RE: K8s Migration Complete — Post-Mortem Scheduled

Marcus,

Answers to your questions:

1. Engineering leadership meeting — confirmed, I'll prepare a 10-minute summary. Will include the latency percentiles and cost projection.

2. Finance coordination — I've already reached out to Priya on the finance team. She's pulling the baseline compute costs from our AWS billing console. We should have a validated comparison by end of next week.

3. Runbook template — great idea. I'll add it as an action item in the post-mortem. We had an informal runbook for this migration that we can formalize.

4. Percentile breakdown:
   - p50: 45ms (old) → 32ms (new)
   - p75: 120ms (old) → 85ms (new)
   - p90: 245ms (old) → 180ms (new)
   - p95: 310ms (old) → 235ms (new)
   - p99: 380ms (old) → 290ms (new)

   Improvements across the board. The biggest relative improvement is at p50 (29% reduction), which makes sense since the scheduling improvements most benefit the common case.

5. Baseline error rate — our 30-day average error rate outside of maintenance windows is 0.015%. The 0.02% during migration is essentially at baseline. Effectively no migration impact on error rates.

Thanks for the kind words. I'll pass them along to the team — they were up since 1:30 AM for the pre-migration checks and they deserve the recognition.

Lisa,

Those percentile numbers are excellent. The fact that the migration-window error rate (0.02%) is essentially the same as the 30-day baseline (0.015%) is remarkable. Well done.

One more thing — can you also prepare a brief paragraph for the all-hands update? David likes to highlight infrastructure wins during the monthly all-hands and this is a textbook example. Keep it non-technical, focused on the customer impact (zero downtime, faster responses).

I'll let you know if anything else comes up.

Marcus,

Will do. I'll have the all-hands paragraph drafted and sent to David's office by end of day Thursday.

Also noting — the team found one minor issue during the migration that we'll address in the post-mortem. The health check probes on two services (user-preferences and session-manager) were configured with a 5-second timeout, which is too tight for the new pod startup sequence. We temporarily increased them to 15 seconds during migration but need to find the right permanent value. It didn't cause any customer impact but it's the kind of thing we should tune proactively.

Good catch. Let's make sure that gets a proper ticket and doesn't just live in the post-mortem notes. I'd rather over-engineer the health checks now than have them bite us during the DR migration.

Thanks, Lisa.
