NEXTERA SOLUTIONS — SOC 2 TYPE II READINESS ASSESSMENT
Q3 2025 INTERIM REPORT
Prepared by: Priya Mehta, Director of Information Security
Date of Report: September 8, 2025
Distribution: InfoSec Team, Compliance Committee
Document Classification: Internal — Confidential

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This interim report provides the Compliance Committee and InfoSec Team with a comprehensive status update on Nextera Solutions' SOC 2 Type II audit readiness as of September 8, 2025. Deloitte & Touche LLP has been retained as the external auditor for the engagement, consistent with the prior fiscal year arrangement. The observation period under review spans July 1 through December 31, 2025. Nextera Solutions is pursuing attestation across the Security, Availability, and Confidentiality Trust Services Criteria as defined by the AICPA.

As of the date of this report, evidence collection has been completed for 47 of 62 controls, representing a current completion rate of 75.8%. Three open gaps have been identified and documented below, each of which has a defined remediation path that does not require architectural changes to Nextera's production infrastructure. The prior fiscal year audit concluded with zero exceptions, and the operational target for the current engagement is a repeat clean opinion. The audit fee for the Type II engagement is $185,000, unchanged from the FY2024 engagement.

2. REFERENCED ENTITIES AND SYSTEMS

The following individuals, organizations, and systems are referenced throughout this report and are material to the readiness assessment:

    Priya Mehta, Director of Information Security — report author and SOC 2 audit program owner. Priya serves as the primary liaison between Nextera and Deloitte's audit team and is responsible for coordinating evidence collection across all contributing departments.

    Deloitte & Touche LLP — external auditor retained for the SOC 2 Type II engagement. Deloitte has served as Nextera's SOC 2 auditor since the FY2022 engagement and brings institutional knowledge of Nextera's control environment. The engagement partner is Michael Rosenstein, who has led the Nextera account for the past two audit cycles.

    AWS us-east-1 and us-west-2 regions — the primary and secondary production hosting environments for Nextera's SaaS platform infrastructure. All customer-facing services are deployed across both regions with active-passive failover, and the SOC 2 scope includes controls governing access, change management, and monitoring for both regions.

    Nextera Solutions SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria — the specific criteria selected for the Type II attestation: Security (Common Criteria), Availability, and Confidentiality. Processing Integrity and Privacy criteria are not in scope for this engagement, consistent with the prior year.

    Jira ticket INFOSEC-2287 — the master tracking ticket for the SOC 2 readiness program, containing all sub-tasks for evidence collection, gap remediation, auditor communication, and timeline management. As of September 8, there are 147 sub-tasks, of which 98 are marked complete, 31 are in progress, and 18 are in the backlog.

    Kevin Cho, Staff SRE — subject matter expert for infrastructure controls, database-layer encryption, and production environment access management. Kevin is the designated control owner for seven controls in the Security and Confidentiality categories.

3. CONTROL EVIDENCE COLLECTION STATUS

Evidence collection is organized by Trust Services Criteria category. Each control requires one or more evidence artifacts, which may include system configuration screenshots, access logs, policy documents, process documentation, or attestation statements from control owners. Evidence is uploaded to the shared Deloitte evidence repository hosted on Deloitte's secure file transfer platform.

3.1 Security Controls (CC6.x Series)

Total controls in scope: 28
Evidence collected and uploaded: 22
Remaining: 6

The Security criteria represent the largest category in the assessment and cover logical access controls, system boundary protections, change management, and risk management processes. Of the 22 completed controls, evidence packages include IAM role definitions and screenshots from AWS IAM, Okta access policies, VPN configuration exports, network segmentation diagrams, and change management workflow documentation from Jira.

The six remaining controls fall into three groups. First, CC6.1 (privileged access review) is the subject of Gap 1, described in Section 4 below. Second, three controls (CC6.2, CC6.3, and CC6.5) require updated screenshots of firewall rules and security group configurations from the September monthly review, which is scheduled for September 12. Third, two controls (CC6.6 and CC6.8) require attestation statements from the VP of Engineering and the Head of DevOps confirming that their teams follow the documented change management process. These attestation requests were sent on September 3 and responses are expected by September 12.

3.2 Availability Controls (A1.x Series)

Total controls in scope: 18
Evidence collected and uploaded: 14
Remaining: 4

The Availability criteria address system monitoring, incident response, business continuity, and disaster recovery. The 14 completed controls include evidence of uptime monitoring via Datadog, PagerDuty on-call rotation configurations and escalation policies, incident postmortem documentation for Q2 and Q3 incidents, and business continuity plan documentation.

The four remaining controls relate to disaster recovery testing and business continuity exercises. The DR runbook for the us-west-2 failover region was updated in August 2025 to reflect infrastructure changes made during the Q2 platform migration, but the updated runbook has not yet been formally tested in the current observation period. A DR test is scheduled for the week of October 6, which will generate the required evidence artifacts including test execution logs, recovery time measurements, and a post-test report. The remaining three controls require documentation of the business continuity tabletop exercise (related to Gap 3 in Section 4 below).

3.3 Confidentiality Controls (C1.x Series)

Total controls in scope: 16
Evidence collected and uploaded: 11
Remaining: 5

The Confidentiality criteria cover data classification, encryption, confidential data handling procedures, and data retention and disposal. The 11 completed controls include the data classification framework document, encryption-at-rest configurations for AWS S3, RDS, and EBS volumes, encryption-in-transit configurations (TLS 1.2/1.3 enforcement), and data handling training completion records.

The five remaining controls include data classification policy attestations from three department heads (Engineering, Sales, and Customer Success) that are pending signature. These attestations confirm that each department follows the data classification framework when handling confidential information. The attestation forms were distributed on August 28, and two of three have been returned. The Customer Success department head attestation is expected by September 12. The other two remaining controls relate to encryption key management documentation for legacy database clusters, which is the subject of Gap 2 in Section 4 below.

4. IDENTIFIED GAPS AND REMEDIATION PLANS

Three open gaps have been identified during the readiness assessment. Each gap is documented below with its Trust Services Criteria reference, a description of the gap, root cause analysis, remediation plan, and target completion date. None of the three gaps require architectural changes to Nextera's production infrastructure, and all remediation activities are within the team's capacity to complete before the November fieldwork window.

Gap 1: Privileged Access Review Cadence (CC6.1)

Criteria Reference: CC6.1 — The entity restricts logical access to information assets, including logical access to infrastructure, applications, and data, and validates that access on a periodic basis.

Description: Nextera's privileged access review policy requires quarterly reviews of all privileged accounts across AWS IAM, Okta, database superuser accounts, and CI/CD pipeline service accounts. The Q1 2025 and Q3 2025 reviews were completed on schedule. However, the Q2 2025 review, which was due for completion by June 30, was completed on July 11 — eleven days past the scheduled deadline. The review itself was thorough and identified no unauthorized access grants, but the late completion represents a control execution failure that auditors are likely to note.

Root Cause: The primary reviewer for the Q2 privileged access review was out on medical leave from June 10 through July 5. No backup reviewer had been designated in the process documentation, and the review was not reassigned until the primary reviewer returned. The absence was not anticipated to extend through the review deadline, and by the time it became clear that coverage was needed, the deadline had passed.

Remediation Plan: A remediation sprint has been scheduled with the IAM team targeting September 19, 2025 for completion. The sprint deliverables include: (a) updating the privileged access review procedure to designate a primary and backup reviewer for each quarterly cycle; (b) implementing automated calendar reminders at 14, 7, and 3 days before each review deadline; (c) documenting the escalation path if a review is at risk of missing its deadline, with escalation to the Director of Information Security at the 7-day mark; (d) conducting a supplementary access review as of September 15 to demonstrate that the control is operating effectively in the current observation period. The IAM team lead has confirmed that the September quarterly review is already underway and on track for on-time completion.

Gap 2: Encryption Key Rotation for Legacy PostgreSQL Clusters (CC6.7)

Criteria Reference: CC6.7 — The entity restricts the transmission, movement, and removal of information to authorized internal and external users and processes, and protects it during transmission, movement, or removal to meet the entity's objectives.

Description: Nextera rotates application-layer encryption keys on a quarterly cycle using AWS KMS. This process is fully automated, logged in CloudTrail, and documented in the encryption management runbook. However, the database-level encryption keys for two legacy PostgreSQL clusters (postgres-legacy-01 and postgres-legacy-02, both in the us-east-1 region) have been rotated manually on an approximately semi-annual basis. The manual rotation process lacks a formal runbook, and rotation events are not logged in a centralized audit trail. The clusters use PostgreSQL native encryption (pgcrypto) rather than the AWS KMS-integrated encryption used by the newer Aurora PostgreSQL instances.

Kevin Cho, Staff SRE, provided the following technical assessment during the readiness review meeting: "The encryption key rotation issue is a tooling gap, not a design flaw. We rotate application-layer keys quarterly but the database-level rotation was manual and undocumented. — Kevin Cho, Staff SRE"

Root Cause: The two legacy PostgreSQL clusters predate Nextera's migration to Aurora PostgreSQL, which was completed for all other database workloads in Q4 2024. The legacy clusters support two internal tools (the legacy reporting engine and the migration verification service) and were deprioritized for migration because they do not handle customer data directly. Because they were not part of the Aurora migration, they were not included in the automated KMS-based key rotation framework. The manual rotation was performed by the on-call SRE as a periodic maintenance task without formal scheduling or documentation.

Remediation Plan: The SRE team will complete the following by October 1, 2025: (a) create a formal runbook for legacy PostgreSQL encryption key rotation, including step-by-step procedures, verification steps, and rollback instructions; (b) implement logging for all key rotation events to a centralized audit log in CloudWatch, with retention configured for 12 months; (c) schedule quarterly key rotations aligned with the application-layer KMS rotation cycle, with the next rotation to be performed under the new documented process in October; (d) create a Jira ticket template for each scheduled rotation event to provide an audit trail of execution. The two legacy clusters are scheduled for migration to Aurora PostgreSQL in Q1 2026 as part of the legacy decommissioning project, at which point they will inherit the automated KMS-based key rotation and this manual process will be retired.

Gap 3: Incident Response Tabletop Exercise Documentation (CC7.2)

Criteria Reference: CC7.2 — The entity monitors system components and the operation of those components for anomalies that are indicative of malicious acts, natural disasters, and errors affecting the entity's ability to meet its objectives; anomalies are analyzed to determine whether they represent security events.

Description: Nextera's incident response program includes semi-annual tabletop exercises to test the organization's ability to respond to security incidents. The H1 2025 tabletop exercise was conducted on April 14, 2025, with participation from InfoSec, Engineering, SRE, Legal, and Communications teams. The exercise simulated a ransomware attack affecting the us-east-1 production environment. However, the formal documentation package for the exercise was not completed. The required documentation includes the exercise scenario description, full participant list with roles, chronological log of decisions and actions, lessons learned, and follow-up action items with owners and due dates.

Root Cause: The exercise was facilitated by Senior Security Analyst Raj Patel, who departed Nextera on May 16, 2025, for a position at another company. Raj had drafted partial notes during the exercise but had not compiled the formal documentation package before his departure. The incomplete notes were found in Raj's Confluence space after his departure, but they lacked the structured format required by the SOC 2 evidence template. No handoff of the documentation responsibility occurred during Raj's notice period, as the departure was handled by HR and the documentation gap was not identified until the evidence collection process began in August.

Remediation Plan: The InfoSec team will address this gap through two parallel workstreams. First, the H1 2025 tabletop exercise documentation will be reconstructed using the following source materials: the Zoom meeting recording from April 14 (retained in the InfoSec shared drive), Slack channel archives from #incident-response and #tabletop-exercise channels for the day of the exercise, Raj Patel's partial notes in Confluence, and interviews with three participating team leads who have confirmed their availability for a documentation reconstruction session on September 16. Second, the H2 2025 tabletop exercise is scheduled for October 22, 2025, and a comprehensive documentation checklist has been created to ensure real-time capture of all required elements during the exercise. A designated scribe (separate from the facilitator) will be assigned to each future exercise. Jira ticket INFOSEC-2287 has been updated with sub-tasks for both the retroactive H1 documentation and the H2 exercise preparation.

5. OBSERVATION PERIOD AND AUDIT TIMELINE

The formal observation period for the current SOC 2 Type II engagement runs from July 1 through December 31, 2025. Deloitte & Touche LLP has been requested to provide written confirmation of this window, and Nextera expects the confirmation letter by September 15, 2025.

Key milestones in the audit timeline:

    July 1, 2025 — Observation period begins
    September 8, 2025 — Interim readiness report (this document)
    September 12, 2025 — Outstanding attestation statements due from department heads
    September 15, 2025 — Deloitte confirmation of observation period window expected
    September 16, 2025 — H1 tabletop exercise documentation reconstruction session
    September 19, 2025 — CC6.1 remediation sprint completion target
    October 1, 2025 — CC6.7 encryption key rotation documentation and logging implementation target
    October 6, 2025 — Disaster recovery test (us-west-2 failover) scheduled
    October 22, 2025 — H2 2025 incident response tabletop exercise
    November 3, 2025 — Deloitte on-site fieldwork begins (tentative, pending confirmation)
    November 3-14, 2025 — On-site fieldwork window (two weeks)
    December 31, 2025 — Observation period ends
    January 2026 — Deloitte reviews final evidence packages and prepares draft report
    February 2026 — Draft Type II report expected from Deloitte for management review
    March 2026 — Final Type II report issuance target

6. FINANCIAL SUMMARY

The audit fee for the SOC 2 Type II engagement is $185,000, consistent with the FY2024 engagement fee. This amount covers the full Type II examination including planning, interim testing, on-site fieldwork, evidence review, management representation letter processing, and final report issuance. The fee was negotiated during the Q1 2025 engagement letter renewal and is locked for two fiscal years. No additional fees are expected unless the scope of criteria is expanded beyond Security, Availability, and Confidentiality to include Processing Integrity or Privacy.

Internal labor costs for the SOC 2 readiness program are tracked in Jira under INFOSEC-2287. As of September 8, approximately 340 hours of internal labor have been logged across the InfoSec, SRE, Engineering, and IT Governance teams. The total internal labor estimate for the full audit cycle (preparation through report issuance) is 600 hours.

7. CONCLUSION AND NEXT STEPS

Priya Mehta provided the following summary assessment: "We are on track for the Type II audit window. The three open gaps are manageable — none require architectural changes, just process documentation and scheduling. — Priya Mehta"

The InfoSec team will provide a follow-up status report on October 6, 2025, covering remediation progress on all three gaps, updated evidence collection metrics, and preliminary results from the disaster recovery test. The Compliance Committee is asked to review this report and submit any questions or additional information requests by September 15, 2025, so they can be addressed before the Deloitte confirmation call.

NEXTERA SOLUTIONS — QUARTERLY VENDOR SECURITY ASSESSMENT
Q3 2025 REVIEW CYCLE
Vendors Under Review: Datadog Inc., PagerDuty Inc., Snowflake Inc.
Prepared by: Marcus Bell, Vendor Risk Analyst
Date: September 8, 2025
Distribution: Procurement, InfoSec, Legal
Document Classification: Internal — Restricted

1. OVERVIEW AND METHODOLOGY

This report documents the Q3 2025 quarterly vendor security assessment for three of Nextera Solutions' critical SaaS infrastructure vendors: Datadog Inc. (application performance monitoring and logging), PagerDuty Inc. (incident management and on-call scheduling), and Snowflake Inc. (cloud data warehouse). These three vendors are classified as Tier 1 critical vendors under Nextera's vendor risk management program, meaning that a significant disruption to any of them would directly impact Nextera's ability to deliver services to customers.

Assessments were conducted using the SIG Lite questionnaire framework, supplemented by review of each vendor's most recent SOC 2 Type II audit report, publicly available security certifications, data processing agreements, and contractual terms. The SIG Lite (Standardized Information Gathering) questionnaire is a streamlined version of the Shared Assessments Program's full SIG questionnaire containing 74 questions across 18 risk domains. Nextera utilizes SIG Lite for Tier 1 and Tier 2 vendors on a quarterly cycle. The full SIG questionnaire (386 questions) is reserved for annual deep-dive assessments and onboarding assessments for new Tier 1 vendors.

Each vendor is scored on a 100-point composite scale that weights the following categories: security program maturity (25%), data protection controls (20%), incident response capabilities (15%), business continuity and resilience (15%), regulatory compliance posture (15%), and contractual protections (10%).

2. REFERENCED ENTITIES

    Marcus Bell, Vendor Risk Analyst — assessment author and vendor risk program owner at Nextera Solutions. Marcus conducts all quarterly vendor assessments and maintains the vendor risk register.

    Datadog Inc. — provides application performance monitoring (APM), log management, infrastructure monitoring, and real-user monitoring (RUM) for Nextera's production environment. Nextera has been a Datadog customer since 2021.

    PagerDuty Inc. — provides incident management, on-call rotation scheduling, escalation workflows, and status page capabilities. Nextera has been a PagerDuty customer since 2019.

    Snowflake Inc. — provides the primary cloud data warehouse for Nextera's analytics, reporting, and data science workloads. Nextera migrated to Snowflake from Amazon Redshift in 2023.

    SIG Lite questionnaire framework — the standardized assessment instrument developed by the Shared Assessments Program, used as the primary data collection tool for Nextera's vendor security reviews.

3. ASSESSMENT RESULTS BY VENDOR

3.1 Datadog Inc.

Vendor Risk Score: 92 out of 100 (Low Risk)
Annual Spend: $412,000
Contract Type: Enterprise subscription, annual commitment
Contract Status: Active, renewal date August 2026
Business Criticality: Tier 1 — Critical Infrastructure

Assessment Process:
SIG Lite questionnaires were distributed to all three vendors on August 25, 2025. Datadog returned the completed assessment on September 3, 2025, which represents 9 calendar days of turnaround — well within the 15-day SLA established in Nextera's vendor risk management policy. Datadog's response was thorough, with all 74 questions answered and 12 supporting documents attached, including their current SOC 2 Type II report, ISO 27001 certificate, penetration testing executive summary, and business continuity plan overview.

SOC 2 Type II Report Review:
Datadog's most recent SOC 2 Type II report is dated June 2025 and covers the observation period January 1 through December 31, 2024. The report was issued by Ernst & Young LLP. No exceptions were noted in the examination. The report covers all five Trust Services Criteria (Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy).

The subservice organization carve-outs in the report are unchanged from the prior year. Datadog carves out the following subservice organizations: Amazon Web Services (primary infrastructure hosting), Google Cloud Platform (secondary infrastructure hosting), and Salesforce (customer relationship management). Nextera's review confirmed that the complementary user entity controls (CUECs) applicable to Nextera have not changed and that Nextera's current practices satisfy the CUECs.

Security Certifications and Compliance:
Datadog maintains ISO 27001 certification, which was re-certified in April 2025 by BSI Group. Datadog also maintains SOC 2 Type II attestation (described above), SOC 3 report (publicly available), CSA STAR Level 2 certification, HIPAA compliance (BAA available for eligible customers), and GDPR compliance attestation. Datadog's security program is mature, well-documented, and externally validated through multiple independent assessments.

Data Handling:
Datadog's data retention policy allows customers to configure retention periods for different data types. Nextera's current configuration retains APM trace data for 15 days, log data for 30 days, and infrastructure metrics for 15 months. These settings are consistent with Nextera's internal data retention policy and the SOC 2 evidence retention requirements. All data transmitted to Datadog is encrypted in transit using TLS 1.2 or higher, and data at rest is encrypted using AES-256.

Scoring Breakdown: Security program (24/25), Data protection (19/20), Incident response (14/15), Business continuity (14/15), Regulatory compliance (14/15), Contractual protections (7/10). Total: 92/100.

Recommendation: Maintain current vendor relationship. No action items.

3.2 PagerDuty Inc.

Vendor Risk Score: 87 out of 100 (Low Risk)
Annual Spend: $78,000
Contract Type: Enterprise subscription, annual commitment
Contract Status: Active, renewal date October 15, 2025
Business Criticality: Tier 1 — Critical Infrastructure

Assessment Process:
SIG Lite questionnaire was distributed on August 25, 2025. PagerDuty returned the completed assessment on September 5, 2025 (11 calendar days, within the 15-day SLA). PagerDuty's response addressed all questions and included their SOC 2 Type II report and updated data processing addendum.

SOC 2 Type II Report Review:
PagerDuty's most recent SOC 2 Type II report covers the observation period January 1 through June 30, 2025. PagerDuty issues SOC 2 reports on a semi-annual basis, which provides more frequent attestation than the typical annual cycle. No exceptions were noted in the report. The report covers Security, Availability, and Confidentiality Trust Services Criteria.

Data Processing Addendum (DPA) Update:
PagerDuty issued an updated DPA effective September 1, 2025. The primary change in the updated DPA is a revised sub-processor list. Two new sub-processor entities have been added, both located in the European Union:

    (1) CloudServe GmbH (Frankfurt, Germany) — a cloud infrastructure provider used for PagerDuty's EU data residency option. This sub-processor handles compute and storage for PagerDuty customers who have selected the EU data residency configuration.

    (2) AnalyticsBridge Ltd. (Dublin, Ireland) — an analytics services company providing aggregate usage telemetry processing. This sub-processor receives anonymized, aggregated usage data for PagerDuty's product analytics and does not process customer-specific incident data.

While neither sub-processor handles Nextera customer data directly (Nextera's PagerDuty instance is hosted in the US and does not use the EU data residency option), the revised sub-processor list represents a material change to the DPA that requires legal review per Nextera's vendor management policy. The addition of any new sub-processor, regardless of whether Nextera data flows to that sub-processor, triggers a mandatory legal review to assess potential GDPR implications and confirm that the contractual flow-down provisions remain adequate.

Action Required: Legal must review and sign off on PagerDuty's revised DPA before the October 15, 2025 contract renewal. The contract includes an auto-renewal clause that triggers 30 days before the renewal date, so the DPA review must be completed by September 15 to allow time for any negotiation if needed.

Operational Performance:
PagerDuty's status page shows 99.98% uptime over the trailing 12 months, exceeding their contractual SLA commitment of 99.9%. There were two brief service degradations in the trailing period: a 12-minute partial API latency spike on March 18, 2025, and a 23-minute notification delivery delay on June 2, 2025. Neither incident resulted in missed notifications for Nextera, and PagerDuty published detailed postmortem reports for both incidents.

Scoring Breakdown: Security program (22/25), Data protection (18/20), Incident response (14/15), Business continuity (13/15), Regulatory compliance (13/15), Contractual protections (7/10). Total: 87/100.

Recommendation: Maintain current vendor relationship. Complete legal review of revised DPA before October 15 renewal.

3.3 Snowflake Inc.

Vendor Risk Score: 94 out of 100 (Low Risk)
Annual Spend: $1.34M
Contract Type: Enterprise capacity commitment, annual
Contract Status: Active, renewal date January 15, 2026
Business Criticality: Tier 1 — Critical Infrastructure

Assessment Process:
SIG Lite questionnaire was distributed on August 25, 2025. Snowflake requested a 10-day extension on September 4, 2025, citing internal resource scheduling constraints related to their annual security certification renewal cycle. Expected completion date: September 18, 2025. The extension request was granted, given Snowflake's strong historical assessment performance and the fact that the extended deadline falls within the quarterly review period. Snowflake has received scores of 93, 94, and 95 in the prior three quarterly assessments.

FedRAMP Authorization:
Snowflake's FedRAMP Moderate authorization was confirmed as active through March 2026. The authorization is maintained through the FedRAMP Program Management Office's continuous monitoring program, which requires monthly vulnerability scanning, quarterly reporting, and annual assessment. Snowflake's most recent continuous monitoring submission was reviewed in July 2025 with no findings. While Nextera does not currently require FedRAMP authorization for its vendor relationships (Nextera is not a federal contractor), the FedRAMP certification provides substantial additional assurance regarding Snowflake's security controls, vulnerability management, incident response, and governance practices, as FedRAMP Moderate requires compliance with 325 security controls derived from NIST SP 800-53.

SOC 2 Type II Report:
Snowflake's most recent Type II report, covering the observation period July 1, 2024, through June 30, 2025, is expected to be available by October 2025. The prior year report (July 2023 through June 2024) contained no exceptions. Nextera will review the updated report during the Q4 vendor review cycle in December 2025.

Contract Renewal Preparation:
The January 15, 2026 contract renewal represents Nextera's largest single SaaS vendor renewal by spend. Snowflake's consumption-based pricing model means that actual costs can vary from the committed capacity, and Nextera's consumption has tracked approximately 8% above committed capacity for the past two quarters. Procurement has been notified of the renewal timeline and will begin vendor negotiation preparation in November 2025, with the goal of securing a volume discount that reflects Nextera's growth trajectory.

Scoring Breakdown: Security program (24/25), Data protection (20/20), Incident response (14/15), Business continuity (15/15), Regulatory compliance (14/15), Contractual protections (7/10). Total: 94/100. (Note: final score pending completion of SIG Lite questionnaire; preliminary score based on prior assessment data and available documentation.)

Recommendation: Maintain current vendor relationship. Complete review of updated SOC 2 report in Q4 cycle. Begin renewal negotiation preparation in November.

4. OVERALL RISK ASSESSMENT AND SUMMARY

Marcus Bell provided the following summary assessment: "All three vendors remain within acceptable risk tolerance. The only action item is legal sign-off on PagerDuty's revised DPA before the October renewal. — Marcus Bell"

Vendor Risk Score Summary:
    Datadog Inc. — 92/100 (Low Risk)
    PagerDuty Inc. — 87/100 (Low Risk)
    Snowflake Inc. — 94/100 (Low Risk, pending SIG Lite completion)

Combined Annual Spend: $1,830,000 ($412,000 + $78,000 + $1,340,000)

No vendors assessed in this cycle require escalation to the Compliance Committee or placement on the vendor risk watch list. All three vendors maintain robust security programs with independent third-party attestation and no material concerns were identified.

5. UPCOMING MILESTONES

    September 15, 2025 — PagerDuty DPA legal review due
    September 18, 2025 — Snowflake SIG Lite response expected
    October 15, 2025 — PagerDuty contract auto-renewal date
    December 2025 — Next quarterly vendor review cycle begins

    CrowdStrike Falcon — Nextera's endpoint detection and response (EDR) platform. CrowdStrike Falcon is deployed on all corporate-managed devices (laptops and workstations) and is now required on personal devices enrolled in the BYOD program. The Falcon agent provides real-time threat detection, behavioral analysis, and device health attestation.

3. ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY v4.2 — DETAILED SUMMARY OF CHANGES

The Acceptable Use Policy has been updated from version 4.1 (effective March 15, 2025) to version 4.2. Version 4.1 addressed general information system usage, email and messaging standards, internet usage, personal use of corporate resources, and data handling. Version 4.2 retains all existing sections and adds one new section and modifies one existing section as described below.

3.1 Section 7.4 — Generative AI Tool Usage (NEW SECTION)

This is the most significant change in the v4.2 update. The new section establishes Nextera's policy governing employee use of generative AI tools for work purposes. The key provisions are:

    (a) Employees must use only generative AI tools that appear on the Nextera Internal AI Registry when performing work-related tasks, accessing company data, or producing work product intended for use in Nextera's business operations.

    (b) The AI Registry is maintained by the IT Governance team and published on Confluence at confluence.nextera.io/it-governance/ai-registry. The registry is reviewed monthly by the IT Governance Committee, and tools may be added or removed based on security assessments, contractual terms, and business needs.

    (c) As of September 8, 2025, the AI Registry includes the following 11 approved tools:

        1. GitHub Copilot — code completion and generation (Engineering department, IDE integration)
        2. ChatGPT Enterprise — general-purpose language model (OpenAI, enterprise license with data isolation)
        3. Grammarly Business — writing assistance and grammar checking (all departments)
        4. Jasper AI — marketing content generation (Marketing department)
        5. Notion AI — document drafting and summarization (all departments, integrated with Nextera's Notion workspace)
        6. Otter.ai — meeting transcription and summarization (all departments)
        7. Midjourney — image generation (Marketing department only, brand asset creation)
        8. Anthropic Claude for Business — general-purpose language model (enterprise license, all departments)
        9. Databricks AI/BI — data analysis and business intelligence (Analytics team, restricted access)
        10. Amazon CodeWhisperer — code completion (Engineering department, AWS-integrated workflows)
        11. Tableau AI — visualization and insight generation (Analytics and Business Intelligence teams)

    (d) Employees are prohibited from entering Nextera proprietary data, customer data, personally identifiable information (PII), protected health information (PHI), or confidential business information into any AI tool not on the approved registry. This prohibition applies regardless of whether the tool offers enterprise-grade data isolation or contractual confidentiality protections.

    (e) Employees who identify a generative AI tool they believe should be added to the registry may submit a request through the IT self-service portal in ServiceNow. The IT Governance team will conduct a security and privacy assessment of the tool within 15 business days of the request and communicate the decision to the requesting employee.

    (f) Violations of this section will be handled through the standard information security incident response process. First-time violations resulting from use of unapproved tools where no sensitive data was exposed will be addressed through education and counseling. Violations involving exposure of sensitive data will be escalated per the data breach response plan.

Diana Rosales provided the following context for this policy addition: "The AI usage additions reflect the reality that 68% of our engineering staff reported using at least one generative AI tool in the Q2 survey. We need guardrails, not bans. — Diana Rosales"

Background on the Q2 2025 AI Usage Survey:
The Q2 2025 internal survey on AI tool usage was conducted across all departments from June 1-15, 2025, with a 72% response rate (288 of 398 employees). Key findings from the survey:
    — 68% of engineering employees reported using at least one generative AI tool for work purposes
    — 42% of non-engineering employees reported using at least one generative AI tool for work purposes
    — Of all AI tool users, approximately 30% reported using at least one tool that was not on any approved list at the time of the survey
    — The most commonly used unapproved tools were personal ChatGPT accounts (not the Enterprise version), Google Gemini, and various open-source code generation tools
    — 89% of AI tool users said they would comply with an approved registry as long as the registry included "the tools that actually work"

The IT Governance Committee considered the survey results during its July 2025 meeting and directed Diana Rosales to develop the AI registry and policy language that is now incorporated into AUP v4.2.

3.2 Section 3.2 — Personal Device Usage (MODIFIED)

The existing language on personal device usage has been updated to align with the new BYOD enrollment requirements introduced in Remote Access Policy v3.1. The modified language specifies that employees who access corporate SaaS applications from personal devices must enroll those devices in the Nextera BYOD program. The enrollment process and requirements are detailed in the Remote Access Policy and summarized in Section 5 of this bulletin.

BYOD enrollment is currently at 34% of the Nextera workforce. The IT Governance Committee has established a target of 80% enrollment by the end of Q4 2025. The gap between current enrollment and the target is concentrated in the Sales and Marketing departments, where personal device usage for accessing corporate applications (particularly Salesforce, Slack, and email) is most common. A targeted enrollment campaign for Sales and Marketing will be conducted in October 2025.

4. REMOTE ACCESS POLICY v3.1 — DETAILED SUMMARY OF CHANGES

The Remote Access Policy has been updated from version 3.0 (effective January 10, 2025) to version 3.1. The primary changes are the addition of a pre-connect endpoint verification requirement and a new BYOD device enrollment section.

4.1 Section 4.1 — Endpoint Verification Before VPN Establishment (MODIFIED)

Effective September 8, 2025, all VPN connections to the Nextera corporate network require that the connecting device has the CrowdStrike Falcon agent installed, running, and reporting a healthy status before the VPN tunnel is established. Under the previous policy (RAP v3.0), CrowdStrike verification was performed after VPN connection as a post-connect health check — meaning that a device could briefly access the corporate network before the health check determined whether it met security requirements. The updated policy moves verification to the pre-connect stage, implementing a "verify-then-connect" model.

The pre-connect verification is implemented through Okta's Device Trust integration with CrowdStrike. When an employee initiates a VPN connection, the VPN client communicates with Okta, which queries the CrowdStrike cloud API to verify that: (a) the Falcon agent is installed on the connecting device, (b) the agent is running and communicating with the CrowdStrike cloud, (c) the agent's sensor version is within the supported version range, and (d) no critical unresolved security alerts exist for the device. If any of these checks fail, the VPN connection is denied and the employee receives a notification with instructions for remediation.

The estimated daily volume of remote access sessions requiring CrowdStrike verification is approximately 2,400 sessions per day across approximately 400 employees. This estimate is based on the average of 6 VPN sessions per remote employee per day, including session reconnections and timeouts, as observed in Q2 2025 VPN usage logs. The Engineering department accounts for approximately 45% of daily VPN sessions, followed by Sales (25%), Customer Success (15%), and other departments (15%).

Pilot Program Results:
The pre-connect verification was tested in a pilot program with the Engineering department during August 2025. The pilot ran for two weeks (August 11-22) and covered approximately 180 employees. Results: zero false denials (no legitimate connections were incorrectly blocked), 3 true denials (employees with outdated Falcon agent versions, resolved within same day through self-service update), and average connection time increase of 0.4 seconds (within acceptable UX threshold). Based on the successful pilot, the IT Governance Committee approved the rollout to all departments.

4.2 Section 5.3 — BYOD Device Enrollment (NEW SECTION)

A new section specifies the requirements and process for personal device enrollment when accessing corporate SaaS applications. The enrollment process is designed to balance security requirements with employee convenience:

    Step 1: Employee submits BYOD enrollment request through the IT self-service portal in ServiceNow. The request form collects device type, operating system version, and intended use case.

    Step 2: IT Operations verifies device compatibility against the following minimum requirements: macOS 13 (Ventura) or later, Windows 11 or later, iOS 16 or later, Android 13 or later. Devices running older operating systems are not eligible for BYOD enrollment due to security limitations.

    Step 3: Employee installs the CrowdStrike Falcon agent and Okta Verify application on the personal device. Installation instructions are provided through the ServiceNow ticket and are also available on the IT support Confluence page. For macOS and iOS devices, installation is facilitated through Jamf Pro. For Windows and Android devices, installation is facilitated through Microsoft Intune.

    Step 4: IT Operations validates that the CrowdStrike agent and Okta Verify are installed, running, and reporting correctly. This validation is performed remotely through Jamf Pro (for macOS/iOS) or Microsoft Intune (for Windows/Android).

    Step 5: Employee signs the BYOD terms of service via DocuSign. The terms of service acknowledge that: corporate data on the personal device may be remotely wiped in the event of device loss, theft, or employment termination; IT Operations may collect device health telemetry (OS version, agent status, encryption status) but will not access personal files, photos, messages, or browsing history; and the employee is responsible for maintaining the device's operating system at a supported version.

    Step 6: Upon completion of all steps, the device is added to the Okta device trust registry, enabling the employee to access corporate SaaS applications (Salesforce, Slack, Jira, Confluence, Gmail, etc.) from the enrolled device.

Enforcement Timeline:
Employees who do not enroll personal devices used for corporate access by the end of Q4 2025 will have access to corporate SaaS applications restricted from those devices. Access from corporate-managed devices (issued by Nextera IT) will not be affected. A 30-day grace period will follow the Q4 deadline before enforcement begins.

5. POLICY ACKNOWLEDGMENT REQUIREMENTS

All Nextera Solutions employees are required to acknowledge both updated policies by September 22, 2025. The acknowledgment process is as follows:

    (a) A DocuSign envelope will be sent to each employee's corporate email address on September 8, 2025, containing a single acknowledgment form covering both policies.

    (b) The acknowledgment form includes a brief summary of the key changes in each policy and a certification statement reading: "I have read and understand the Acceptable Use Policy v4.2 and the Remote Access Policy v3.1. I agree to comply with both policies as a condition of my continued access to Nextera Solutions information systems and resources."

    (c) Employees are expected to read the full policy documents on Confluence before signing the acknowledgment. The acknowledgment form includes direct links to both policy documents.

    (d) The deadline for acknowledgment is September 22, 2025, at 5:00 PM Pacific Time.

    (e) Employees who have not acknowledged by the deadline will receive automated reminder emails on September 19 and September 22. After the deadline, non-acknowledging employees will be reported to their department managers and HR business partners for follow-up per the standard compliance escalation process.

The prior version of the Acceptable Use Policy (v4.1) achieved a 96.3% acknowledgment rate within the two-week deadline. The remaining 3.7% of employees acknowledged within 5 business days of the deadline after manager follow-up. The IT Governance Committee expects a similar acknowledgment rate for the current update.

6. TRAINING AND SUPPORT

Training sessions on the new generative AI usage guidelines will be offered during the weeks of September 15 and September 22. Sessions are organized as follows:

    Engineering Staff Sessions:
    — September 16, 11:00 AM PT (60 minutes, covers GitHub Copilot, CodeWhisperer, and ChatGPT Enterprise usage guidelines)
