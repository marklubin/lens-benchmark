[MEETING BEGINS]

DAVID ALDRIC (CEO): Good afternoon, Nextera! Happy Valentine's Day! And more importantly — happy launch day!

[applause]

Today is a great day. Rec engine v3 is live and our customers are already seeing results. This is what it looks like when a team executes at the highest level.

I want to start by recognizing the people who made this happen. Marcus, Sami, Raj — your engineering team has been working on v3 for eight months. From concept to GA in eight months, with 3,350 tests passing, zero P1 bugs, and performance that exceeded every single target we set. Throughput 15% above target. Latency at p99 of 220ms against a 300ms target. This is world-class engineering.

Let me bring Marcus up to give us a live demo.

MARCUS WEBB (VP Engineering): Thanks, David. I'm going to show you rec engine v3 running live with anonymized customer data. Let me share my screen.

[screen share begins]

What you're seeing here is the v3 recommendation dashboard for a logistics company — anonymized, of course. The company operates 14 shipping lanes between North America and Europe. Let me walk you through what v3 does differently from v2.

First — speed. I'm going to run a route optimization query across all 14 lanes. Watch the response time in the bottom right corner. [clicks] There it is — 142 milliseconds. In v2, this same query took approximately 400 milliseconds. That's a 65% improvement in response time.

Second — accuracy. The v3 recommendation engine uses a new sparse matrix processing algorithm that Raj Patel's team developed. It can handle datasets with 95% sparsity — which is typical for international shipping lane data — without the computational overhead of traditional matrix operations. The result is recommendations that are 23% more accurate than v2 as measured by backtesting against historical shipping decisions.

Third — scale. V3 can process 1,150 queries per second, up from 720 in v2. That means we can serve our largest customers — companies with hundreds of shipping lanes and thousands of daily routing decisions — without any degradation in performance.

Let me show you one more thing. I'm going to simulate a port congestion event at Rotterdam and show how v3 automatically generates alternative route recommendations.

See that? Within 200 milliseconds of detecting the congestion signal, v3 generated three alternative routing options, each with estimated cost impact and delivery time comparison. This is the kind of real-time supply chain intelligence that no other platform can deliver.

[applause]

DAVID ALDRIC: Incredible, Marcus. Thank you. Now let me bring Hannah up for the product roadmap.

HANNAH CHOI (VP Product): Thank you, David. I want to give everyone a preview of what's coming for the rest of the year. Our product roadmap is the most ambitious in Nextera's history.

Q1 (current):
- Rec engine v3 GA — DONE! Shipping today.
- Axion Labs data integration — on track for internal demo February 28, customer beta June, GA September
- Supply chain dashboard redesign — on track for March GA

Q2 (April-June):
- Axion data features beta launch (June)
- NLP query interface — inspired by the hackathon winning project "ChainWhisperer," we're fast-tracking a natural language query capability
- Mobile app redesign — first major mobile update in 18 months
- API v3 with GraphQL support

Q3 (July-September):
- Axion data features GA (September)
- Predictive supply chain disruption module — new ML capability
- Multi-language support (Spanish, German, Mandarin, Japanese)
- Customer self-service analytics builder

Q4 (October-December):
- Next-generation recommendation engine (v4 planning begins)
- AI-powered contract analysis for supply chain agreements
- Platform marketplace for third-party integrations

This roadmap reflects approximately $42M in R&D investment and the efforts of our 150-person engineering team and 22-person product team.

A few additional product highlights:

The hackathon winning project "ChainWhisperer" is being fast-tracked into the product evaluation process. For those who weren't at the hackathon demos, the ChainWhisperer team — Fatima Al-Rashid, Carlos Rivera, Ethan Novak, and Owen Park — built a natural language query interface in 24 hours that can translate plain English questions into supply chain analytics queries. During the demo, they showed queries like "which shipping lanes had the highest delay rates in January?" and the system generated the correct API calls and returned formatted results in under 2 seconds. If the product evaluation confirms market fit, we'll target a beta release in Q3.

The supply chain dashboard redesign is also progressing well. Ben Arujo and Jess Morrow have completed the UX research and the mockups are in final review. Key improvements include: customizable widget layouts (the #1 customer request from Q4), drill-down views that reduce clicks from 4 to 2, export-to-PDF functionality, and a saved-views feature that lets different stakeholders create personalized dashboard configurations. March GA is on track.

One other item I want to highlight: our product team headcount has grown to 22, and we're hiring 2 more PMs in Q1. The product organization is structured into four pods:
1. Core Platform (rec engine, API, infrastructure) — 2 PMs, led by Sami Okoro
2. Analytics & Dashboard (dashboard, reporting, exports) — 2 PMs, led by Ben Arujo
3. Data & Integration (Axion, data providers, ETL) — 1 PM + 1 hiring
4. Growth & Experience (onboarding, mobile, self-service) — 1 PM + 1 hiring

Each pod operates with a dedicated engineering squad of 8-12 engineers. This pod structure allows us to ship independently and move fast while maintaining quality.

Now let me bring Priya up for financials.

PRIYA VASQUEZ (CFO): Thank you, Hannah. Quick financial update. Q1 is shaping up to be our best quarter ever. Revenue is tracking 5% above plan. Bookings are 14% above target through mid-February. ARR has grown from $118.7M at year-end to approximately $121M today. Cash position is healthy at $26.5M.

Our gross margin has improved to 79.1%, driven by the K8s migration cost savings and the increasing proportion of subscription revenue. We're on track for EBITDA breakeven in Q4, which is a major milestone for the company.

I won't go deep on numbers today — this is a launch party! But I want to emphasize: the financial health of this company has never been stronger. We are well-capitalized, growing, and in control of our own destiny.

DAVID ALDRIC: Thank you, Priya. Now I want to address a few things directly.

Let me address the elephant in the room — Sarah Jiang's departure. Board members come and go. Sarah made valuable contributions and we wish her well. Nothing changes about our direction.

I know some of you have been connecting dots between the equity policy update, the Axion partnership, and Sarah's departure. I understand the impulse. When you work at a company you care about, you pay attention to these things. That's a good instinct. But in this case, the dots don't connect.

The equity acceleration policy update was a routine market alignment that we would have done regardless of any other circumstances. The Compensia data supports it. The Axion partnership is a product investment — better data for our customers. And Sarah's departure was her personal decision based on her own strategic views.

We are not for sale. We are not looking to be acquired. We are building a company that will outlast all of us. When someone asks you about Nextera's future, tell them: we're just getting started.

Now let me take your questions.

[Q&A SESSION — 10 QUESTIONS]

EMPLOYEE (Engineering): Marcus, can you talk about the hackathon results? The ChainWhisperer project sounds amazing.

MARCUS WEBB: It was incredible. Team ChainWhisperer — led by Fatima Al-Rashid and Carlos Rivera — built a natural language interface that translates plain English questions into supply chain API queries. You type something like "show me all delayed shipments from Shanghai in the last 7 days" and it generates the appropriate API call, fetches the data, and presents it in a formatted table. The prototype was rough around the edges but the core capability is sound. Hannah's team has already started the product evaluation process.

EMPLOYEE (Customer Success): How are customers reacting to rec engine v3 launch?

AMANDA BRIGGS (VP Customer Success): Early reception is outstanding. 47 customers activated v3 on day one — that's 22% of our customer base. We've received overwhelmingly positive feedback from the early adopters. Freight Corp's CTO sent an email this morning saying it "exceeded all expectations."

EMPLOYEE (Finance): Can you talk about the retention bonus program that was announced this morning?

DAVID ALDRIC: Vanessa can address that.

VANESSA KLINE (VP People): Sure. We announced a new Retention Bonus Program today that rewards critical team members for their commitment to Nextera. Eligible employees — approximately 120 people identified as critical talent — will receive a cash retention bonus upon a qualifying event, provided they remain employed through the event date and for 12 months following. The program uses the same "qualifying event" definition as the equity acceleration policy: change of control, IPO, or major asset sale.

EMPLOYEE (Product): The equity policy changes and Sarah's departure feel connected. Can you give us more clarity?

DAVID ALDRIC: They're not connected. The equity changes are routine market alignment. Sarah left for personal reasons. I understand why people connect dots, but these dots don't connect.

I want to be as transparent as I can be. The equity acceleration policy was something we'd been working on since Q3 last year. Vanessa's team ran the Compensia benchmarking study in October, and the board approved the update in January. The timing is coincidental with Sarah's departure, not causal.

Sarah was a valuable board member. She had strong views about the company's strategic direction — specifically, she was a passionate advocate for organic growth. That's a legitimate strategic perspective and I respect it. But the board's direction is the board's direction, and Sarah felt she couldn't continue to serve on a board whose direction she disagreed with. That's her prerogative and I respect her decision.

EMPLOYEE (Engineering): What's the long-term vision for the recommendation engine? v4?

MARCUS WEBB: v3 is a major architectural leap. The sparse matrix processing and the real-time optimization capabilities give us a platform we can build on for 2-3 years. v4, when it comes, will likely incorporate the Axion data natively and introduce multi-objective optimization — meaning customers can optimize for cost, time, carbon footprint, and risk simultaneously. But that's Q4 2025 planning territory at the earliest.

EMPLOYEE (Sales): How is the Axion partnership landing with prospects?

KEVIN OROSCO (VP Sales): Extremely well. We've had 8 inbound leads since the announcement — three are enterprise quality. Every prospect I've talked to in the last two weeks has mentioned the Axion data coverage expansion. It's a genuine competitive differentiator. Kinaxis and Palantir can't match 340+ shipping lanes with real-time data.

EMPLOYEE (Engineering): Lisa, how is the K8s migration performing post-cutover?

LISA CHEN (Director, Platform): Clean. Zero customer-facing downtime during the migration. p99 latency improved from 380ms to 290ms. Error rate during migration was 0.02% — well below our 0.5% threshold. And the early cost data is encouraging: we're seeing a 42% reduction in compute costs. Annualized, that's $1.68M in savings.

EMPLOYEE (HR): Vanessa, can you explain the retention bonus tiers?

VANESSA KLINE: Sure. There are three tiers based on role criticality: Tier 1 (approximately 20 employees) receives 100% of base salary; Tier 2 (approximately 40 employees) receives 50% of base salary; and Tier 3 (approximately 60 employees) receives 25% of base salary. The bonus is paid upon a qualifying event — provided you remain employed through the event and for 12 months after. Enrollment requires signing a retention agreement that includes an 18-month post-event non-compete. Information sessions are February 18 and 20. Enrollment deadline is March 15.

EMPLOYEE (Engineering): The non-compete clause feels aggressive. Can you elaborate?

VANESSA KLINE: The 18-month non-compete is standard for retention bonus programs at companies our size. It only applies to employees who voluntarily enroll in the program and only activates upon a qualifying event. If no qualifying event occurs, the non-compete never takes effect. And in California, non-competes are generally unenforceable under California Business and Professions Code Section 16600 — though this could apply in other jurisdictions. We recommend consulting with an attorney if you have concerns.

DAVID ALDRIC: Thank you, everyone. I want to close by saying this: today is a celebration. Rec engine v3 is a genuine breakthrough. The Axion integration is progressing beautifully. Our financial results are the best in our history. We have 410 incredible people building the future of supply chain intelligence.

Happy Valentine's Day, Nextera. There are heart-shaped cookies in the auditorium lobby. Enjoy the rest of your afternoon.

NEW RETENTION BONUS PROGRAM — EFFECTIVE MARCH 1, 2025

We're excited to announce a new Retention Bonus Program designed to reward our most critical team members for their commitment to Nextera.

PROGRAM OVERVIEW

Eligible employees will receive a cash retention bonus upon the occurrence of a "qualifying event," provided they remain employed through the event date and for 12 months following.

A qualifying event is defined as: (a) a change of control of Nextera Solutions, (b) an initial public offering, or (c) a sale of substantially all assets exceeding $50M in value.

This program reflects our commitment to rewarding loyalty and ensuring our best people share in Nextera's success, whatever form that takes.

ELIGIBILITY AND TIERS

Approximately 120 employees have been identified as "critical talent" based on role criticality, institutional knowledge, and strategic importance. These employees have been notified individually via email and are eligible to enroll in the program.

Tier 1 — Critical Leadership (approximately 20 employees):
- Bonus: 100% of base salary
- Roles: Senior directors, technical fellows, key architects, and essential leadership positions
- Estimated total Tier 1 payout: $3.2M

Tier 2 — Key Contributors (approximately 40 employees):
- Bonus: 50% of base salary
- Roles: Managers with critical institutional knowledge, specialized engineers, key customer relationships
- Estimated total Tier 2 payout: $2.8M

Tier 3 — Critical Individual Contributors (approximately 60 employees):
- Bonus: 25% of base salary
- Roles: High-performing individual contributors in engineering, sales, and customer success
- Estimated total Tier 3 payout: $2.2M

Total program cost estimate: $8.2M upon qualifying event

ENROLLMENT REQUIREMENTS

To participate, eligible employees must sign a Retention Agreement that includes:

1. Commitment to remain employed through a qualifying event and for 12 months following
2. An 18-month post-qualifying-event non-compete clause (applicable in jurisdictions where enforceable)
3. Non-solicitation clause covering Nextera employees and customers for 18 months post-event
4. Confidentiality provisions regarding the terms of the retention agreement

The retention agreement is voluntary. No employee is required to enroll. However, the retention bonus is only available to employees who have signed the agreement prior to the enrollment deadline.

ENROLLMENT DEADLINE: March 15, 2025

INFORMATION SESSIONS

Two information sessions are scheduled:
- February 18, 2025, 2:00 PM — Main auditorium + Zoom
- February 20, 2025, 10:00 AM — Main auditorium + Zoom

Both sessions will cover the program details, answer questions, and walk through the retention agreement. Attendance is optional but recommended for all eligible employees.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

Q: Why is the company introducing this program now?
A: We regularly benchmark our compensation programs against the market. Retention bonus programs are standard at companies our size and stage. This is part of our overall talent retention strategy.

Q: Does this mean the company is planning a transaction?
A: No. The program covers multiple qualifying events, including IPO, which is the most commonly cited qualifying event in similar programs at peer companies. The program is designed to be prepared for various growth scenarios, not to signal any specific plan.

Q: What if no qualifying event occurs?
A: If no qualifying event occurs during your employment, the retention agreement has no financial effect. The non-compete and non-solicitation provisions only activate upon a qualifying event.

Q: Can I opt out after enrolling?
A: Yes. You may terminate the retention agreement with 30 days written notice. Upon termination, you forfeit eligibility for the retention bonus. The non-compete and non-solicitation provisions would also terminate.

Q: How was "critical talent" determined?
A: Critical talent was identified by each VP in consultation with the People Team based on role criticality, institutional knowledge, technical specialization, customer relationship importance, and difficulty of replacement. If you believe you should have been included and were not, please reach out to your VP or to people@nextera.io.

Q: Are executives eligible?
A: C-suite executives have separate compensation arrangements and are not part of this program. VP-level executives may be eligible depending on their individual employment agreements.

Q: How does the retention bonus interact with the equity acceleration policy?
A: They are separate programs. The equity acceleration policy governs what happens to your unvested equity upon a qualifying event. The retention bonus provides an additional cash payment for employees who enroll. You can benefit from both programs simultaneously.

Q: What happens if I'm terminated before a qualifying event?
A: If you are terminated (whether voluntarily or involuntarily) before a qualifying event, the retention agreement terminates and you receive no retention bonus. The non-compete and non-solicitation provisions also terminate upon your departure if no qualifying event has occurred.

Q: Can I negotiate the retention bonus amount?
A: No. Retention bonus amounts are determined by tier and are standardized within each tier. The tier assignment was made by your VP in consultation with the People Team and is not subject to negotiation.

Q: When exactly is the retention bonus paid?
A: The retention bonus is paid within 30 days following the qualifying event date, subject to applicable tax withholdings. If the qualifying event is a change of control, the event date is the closing date of the transaction. If the qualifying event is an IPO, the event date is the effective date of the registration statement. If the qualifying event is an asset sale, the event date is the closing date of the sale.

Q: What if I'm on leave (maternity, medical, sabbatical) at the time of a qualifying event?
A: Employees on approved leave are considered "employed" for purposes of the retention bonus. You remain eligible as long as you are on an approved leave of absence at the time of the qualifying event.

TAX CONSIDERATIONS

Retention bonuses are taxed as supplemental wages. The federal supplemental wage tax rate is 22% for amounts up to $1M and 37% for amounts exceeding $1M. State taxes (California) apply at the marginal rate. FICA taxes apply up to the Social Security wage base ($168,600 for 2025).

The company will withhold applicable taxes at the time of payment. We recommend consulting with a tax advisor to understand the specific impact on your tax situation.

PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION

The Retention Bonus Program is administered by the People Team in coordination with the Finance Team and General Counsel's office. Program documents include:

1. Retention Bonus Program Summary (this document)
2. Individual Retention Agreement (provided to eligible employees via email)
3. Program FAQ (available on the HR intranet)
4. Non-Compete and Non-Solicitation Terms Sheet (appendix to the retention agreement)

All program documents have been reviewed and approved by Rachel Dominguez (General Counsel), Priya Vasquez (CFO), and outside counsel at Cooley LLP.

ENROLLMENT TIMELINE

- February 14: Program announced
- February 18: Information session #1 (2:00 PM)
- February 20: Information session #2 (10:00 AM)
- March 1: Program effective date
- March 15: Enrollment deadline

Eligible employees who do not enroll by March 15 will forfeit eligibility for the current enrollment period. Future enrollment periods may be offered at the company's discretion.

COMPARISON TO PEER COMPANIES

For context, retention bonus programs are common at enterprise software companies in our revenue range:

- 68% of venture-backed enterprise SaaS companies with $100M+ ARR have some form of retention bonus or stay bonus program (source: Compensia 2024 survey)
- Median retention bonus for Tier 1 employees: 75-100% of base salary
- Median retention bonus for Tier 2 employees: 40-60% of base salary
- Median retention bonus for Tier 3 employees: 20-30% of base salary
- Our program is at the median across all tiers

[3:45 PM] priya.vasquez
@jordan.michaels @angela.torres Quick heads up — I have a meeting next Tuesday with external advisors. I need the following by end of day Monday:

1. Updated revenue model through FY2027 (current model stops at FY2026 — please extend)
2. Customer concentration analysis — top 20 accounts by ARR, with concentration percentages
3. Cohort retention data by vintage (FY2022, FY2023, FY2024 cohorts)

I have a meeting next Tuesday with external advisors. I need the following by end of day Monday: updated revenue model through FY2027, customer concentration analysis (top 20 accounts), and cohort retention data by vintage.

[3:48 PM] jordan.michaels
Got it. Should I include the ARR bridge with expansion/contraction detail?

[3:50 PM] priya.vasquez
Jordan: "Got it. Should I include the ARR bridge with expansion/contraction detail?" Vasquez: "Yes, and add a sensitivity analysis at 90%, 100%, and 110% of plan."

Yes, and add a sensitivity analysis at 90%, 100%, and 110% of plan. I want to show three scenarios:
- Bear case: 90% of plan (revenue growth slows, churn increases)
- Base case: 100% of plan (current trajectory continues)
- Bull case: 110% of plan (Axion partnership accelerates growth, rec engine v3 drives expansion)

Each scenario should include:
- Revenue projections by quarter through FY2027
- ARR exit for each year
- EBITDA trajectory
- Cash position at each quarter-end
- Headcount assumptions

[3:54 PM] jordan.michaels
Understood. That's a significant modeling effort — I'll pull Owen Park off his current project to help. We'll have it ready by Monday 5 PM.

[3:56 PM] priya.vasquez
Also please prep a clean cap table as of February 1. Fully diluted.

The cap table should include:
- Common shares outstanding
- Preferred shares by series (Series A, B, C)
- Outstanding options (vested and unvested, by grant date and exercise price)
- RSUs (vested and unvested)
- Warrants
- ESPP shares
- Option pool available
- Fully diluted share count
- 409A valuation per share ($14.20 as of October 2024)
- Implied equity value at 409A
- Ownership percentages by category (founders, investors, employee pool, option pool)

[3:59 PM] angela.torres
I'll prepare the cap table. I have the raw data from Shareworks — just need to format it. Should be ready by Monday morning.

[4:02 PM] jordan.michaels
Priya — one question. The revenue model extension to FY2027 — should I incorporate the Axion partnership revenue impact? At the current $15-25/user/month premium pricing estimate, the Axion features could add $4-6M in incremental ARR by FY2026 and $8-12M by FY2027.

[4:05 PM] priya.vasquez
Yes, include the Axion revenue impact in the bull case. In the base case, include 50% of the estimated Axion impact. In the bear case, assume zero incremental Axion revenue. The advisors will want to see the range.

[4:08 PM] jordan.michaels
Got it. Last question — what's the meeting location? I need to prep a printed board package.

[4:10 PM] priya.vasquez
Meeting: February 18, Goldman Sachs SF office, 180 Sansome Street. Printed materials not needed — they prefer electronic. But have backups on a USB drive just in case.

Meeting attendees: Vasquez + 2 finance team members + Goldman Sachs team

[4:13 PM] angela.torres
Priya — should I attend the Goldman meeting?

[4:15 PM] priya.vasquez
Yes, Angela, please plan to attend. Jordan too. We'll need both of you for financial Q&A. Meeting is 10 AM to 2 PM with a working lunch.

[4:18 PM] jordan.michaels
Blocked on my calendar. We'll be ready.

[4:22 PM] priya.vasquez
A few more items for the Monday prep:

5. Customer lifetime value (LTV) analysis by segment (enterprise, mid-market, emerging)
6. Unit economics summary: LTV/CAC ratio, payback period by segment
7. Revenue breakdown: subscription vs. professional services vs. support (quarterly for last 8 quarters)
8. Operating expense breakdown by function with trend analysis

I know this is a lot. The advisors will want a comprehensive financial picture. This is a detailed engagement and we need to be prepared.

[4:25 PM] angela.torres
I have most of this data already in our quarterly board packages. I'll compile and format. The LTV/CAC analysis will take the most work — we last ran it in Q3 2024 and need to update with Q4 data.

Preliminary LTV/CAC numbers (Q3 2024, to be updated):
- Enterprise LTV: $1.1M (5-year projected)
- Enterprise CAC: $185K
- Enterprise LTV/CAC: 5.9x
- Mid-market LTV: $248K (5-year projected)
- Mid-market CAC: $62K
- Mid-market LTV/CAC: 4.0x
- Blended LTV/CAC: 4.8x
- Blended payback period: 14 months

[4:28 PM] jordan.michaels
Those are strong unit economics. I'll update with Q4 actuals and the latest churn data. I expect the numbers to improve slightly given Q4's strong retention performance.

[4:31 PM] priya.vasquez
Good. One last thing — please ensure all materials are on the encrypted shared drive (Finance > External Advisors). Do not email these materials. I'll provide the meeting link and access credentials on Monday morning.

This data is sensitive and should not be shared with anyone outside the finance team. If anyone asks what the Tuesday meeting is about, it's a "routine financial advisory review." No further details.

[4:34 PM] jordan.michaels
Understood. We'll have everything ready by Monday 5 PM on the encrypted drive.

[4:36 PM] angela.torres
Confirmed. I'll also prepare a backup presentation deck in case the advisors want a structured walkthrough rather than raw data. Standard investor presentation format with our brand template.

[4:38 PM] priya.vasquez
Good thinking, Angela. Yes, prepare a deck — 30-40 slides covering company overview, financial performance, growth trajectory, unit economics, and key metrics. Use the board presentation as a starting point but make it more detailed. No mention of Project Lighthouse or any transaction — this is purely a financial overview for advisory purposes.

[4:41 PM] angela.torres
Will do. I'll share a draft with you by Sunday evening for review.

[4:43 PM] priya.vasquez
Perfect. Thank you both. Happy Valentine's Day and enjoy the launch party. :heart:
