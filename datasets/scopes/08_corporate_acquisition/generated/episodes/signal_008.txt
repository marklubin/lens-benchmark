Does anyone have a rec for private dining at Quince? David has a dinner Thursday and wants the private room. Already booked but wondering if anyone's been.

[2:18 PM] megan.cross (EA to CFO)
oh I've been for a birthday! the private room is gorgeous. tell them to do the tasting menu, it's incredible :fork_and_knife:

The wine pairing is also phenomenal. If they're doing the tasting menu, definitely add the wine pairing. Ask for the sommelier — his name is Marco and he's fantastic at matching wines to dietary preferences.

[2:21 PM] carla.nunes
Already reserved, thanks! Private room for 4, tasting menu confirmed.

[2:23 PM] megan.cross
Party of 4? Fun! Is it a customer dinner?

[2:25 PM] carla.nunes
Nope, just business. I'm handling the reservation and car service. Private room is on the second floor — they said they'd have it set up by 7 PM, dinner starts 7:30.

The calendar entry just says "ML — dinner" so I'm not sure of the full context. David didn't give me details beyond the headcount and the restaurant preference.

[2:28 PM] janet.liu (EA to VP Engineering)
Quince is amazing. The tasting menu is like 12 courses, takes about 3 hours. Make sure the car service knows to plan for a late evening.

[2:30 PM] carla.nunes
Good call — scheduling pickup for 10:30 PM just in case. The car service is set up with Blacklane, the usual corporate account.

[2:33 PM] megan.cross
What does David have the rest of this week? I'm trying to schedule a 30-minute prep session with Priya for the January month-end numbers and his calendar looks packed.

[2:35 PM] carla.nunes
Let me check... Monday he has a "Board prep call" in the morning, Tuesday afternoon is "Product review" with Hannah's team, and Wednesday morning is "Axion Labs sync" — that's the new data partnership evaluation. Thursday is the dinner. Friday is open in the afternoon — that might work for the Priya meeting.

Actually, his calendar screenshot also shows a couple of other things but Friday 2-3 PM looks like the best window. Want me to hold it?

[2:38 PM] megan.cross
Yes please! 30 minutes is all we need. I'll send Priya the invite once you confirm.

[2:40 PM] carla.nunes
Done. Friday Jan 31, 2:00-2:30 PM, "Finance Review — January Close" blocked on David's calendar.

[2:42 PM] janet.liu
Speaking of calendars — Marcus's schedule for next week is completely full with K8s migration prep. The Feb 3-7 migration window is their biggest infrastructure project of the year. I've blocked his calendar from Monday through Friday and told everyone to use Sami Okoro as the escalation point for anything non-migration-related.

[2:45 PM] carla.nunes
Makes sense. David is aware of the migration timeline. He asked me to block 30 minutes on Feb 5 morning for a "Migration Status Check" with Marcus — can you find a slot?

[2:47 PM] janet.liu
The cutover is Feb 5 at 2 AM, so Marcus will be up most of the night. How about 11 AM? That gives him time to catch a couple hours of sleep after the cutover completes.

[2:49 PM] carla.nunes
11 AM works. Holding it. Thanks Janet.

[2:52 PM] megan.cross
Quick logistical note for everyone — I'm coordinating the February board meeting logistics. The meeting is scheduled for February 10, 10 AM, via secure video conference (same Zoom room as the January special session). Maria Fuentes will send the formal board package one week ahead. I'll handle catering for any executives joining from the office.

Board members confirmed:
- Robert Kessler (remote, New York)
- Tom Whitfield (remote, Boston)
- Nina Patel (remote, Chicago)
- David Aldric (in office, SF)

Note: Sarah Jiang is still listed on the board roster in our system. Does anyone know if there's been a change? I haven't received any updates from Maria.

[2:55 PM] carla.nunes
I haven't heard anything about Sarah either. I'll check with David tomorrow and let you know.

[2:58 PM] janet.liu
Same — no updates from my end. Probably just needs a roster refresh. You know how slow corporate governance updates are :rolling_eyes:

[3:01 PM] megan.cross
OK, I'll follow up with Maria directly. Moving on — anyone have travel requests for February? I need to submit the monthly travel forecast by Friday.

[3:04 PM] carla.nunes
David has a potential trip to Austin the first week of February — Hannah mentioned visiting Axion Labs' office. But it's not confirmed yet. I'll add it to the forecast as tentative.

[3:07 PM] janet.liu
Marcus might need to travel to our eu-west-1 AWS region in Dublin for the DR migration planning in March. Adding that as tentative for March.

[3:10 PM] megan.cross
Got it. I'll include both in the forecast. Travel budget for the executive team in Q1 is $45K total — we've spent about $8K in January, so we're well within budget.

[3:14 PM] carla.nunes
One more thing — David asked me to order a new batch of Nextera-branded jackets for the executive team. He's been wearing his to all-hands meetings and apparently got a lot of compliments. He wants them for the whole C-suite. I'm ordering through the same vendor as last time (Patagonia corporate) — 8 jackets, navy blue with the Nextera logo embroidered on the chest.

[3:17 PM] megan.cross
Ha! Priya will love that. She's been asking for one since the last company offsite. Good call on Patagonia — the quality is great and they look professional without being stuffy.

[3:20 PM] janet.liu
Marcus already has 3 Nextera hoodies, I'm not sure he needs a jacket :laughing: But I'll make sure he wears it to the next board meeting.

[3:23 PM] carla.nunes
lol. I'll send size requests to everyone's EA. Should have them in 2-3 weeks.

[3:25 PM] megan.cross
Perfect. OK team, I think that covers everything for this week. Let me know if anything changes on the travel front. Have a good rest of the day!

[3:27 PM] carla.nunes
One last note — David's Quince dinner Thursday. The calendar shows Thursday Jan 30, 7:30 PM. The entry says "ML — dinner" with a note about private room for 4. Quince restaurant is in Pacific Heights, San Francisco — Michelin 3-star. I've confirmed the reservation, tasting menu, and car service. Let me know if anyone needs anything else.

[3:29 PM] janet.liu
All set from my end. Have a great week everyone!

I need 2 more — preferably one engineer and one non-technical leader. Volunteers?

Ground rules for hackathon:
- No production systems. Use staging and dev environments only.
- No customer data. Use synthetic datasets (available in the hackathon data repo).
- All code must be original — no pre-written code from prior projects.
- Open source libraries are fine.
- Projects must be demo-able at 3 PM Saturday. No exceptions.
- Frank Gutierrez's data handling guidelines apply (see his announcement from last week).

RECOMMENDATION ENGINE V3 — LAUNCH PREP

rec engine v3 beta: throughput is 15% above our target. Query latency at p99 is 220ms against 300ms target. This thing is ready.

Sami, the rec engine v3 beta performance results are outstanding. Here are the final benchmarks from the last round of testing:

Performance metrics (production-equivalent load):
- Throughput: 1,150 queries/sec (target: 1,000 queries/sec) — 15% above target
- p50 latency: 85ms (target: 150ms)
- p75 latency: 130ms (target: 200ms)
- p99 latency: 220ms (target: 300ms)
- p99.9 latency: 310ms (target: 500ms)
- Error rate: 0.001% (target: <0.01%)

Test suite status:
- Unit tests: 2,341 passing, 0 failing
- Integration tests: 847 passing, 0 failing
- End-to-end tests: 124 passing, 0 failing
- Performance regression tests: 38 passing, 0 failing
- Total test count: 3,350

Bug status:
- P1 (blocker): 0
- P2 (major): 0
- P3 (minor/cosmetic): 2
  - JIRA-4821: Tooltip text truncation on recommendation cards at narrow viewport widths
  - JIRA-4823: CSV export includes an extra trailing comma in the header row

Both P3 issues are cosmetic and will not block launch. They'll be fixed in the v3.0.1 patch release the week after launch.

Subject: RE: Hackathon Logistics + Rec Engine v3 Launch Prep

Marcus,

rec engine v3 final numbers are indeed outstanding. The team has been grinding for 8 months on this release and it shows. A few notes:

1. On the P3 bugs — I'll have JIRA-4821 (tooltip truncation) fixed by Feb 7. JIRA-4823 (CSV trailing comma) is a 10-minute fix that we'll include in the v3.0.1 patch.

2. For the go/no-go meeting on Feb 12, I'll prepare the following materials:
   - Final performance benchmark report (including comparison to v2 baseline)
   - Customer migration playbook (step-by-step for CS team to execute)
   - Rollback plan for v3 (separate from the K8s rollback)
   - Known issues register (currently 2 P3s)
   - Day-1 monitoring dashboard in Datadog

3. For the hackathon — I'll volunteer as the 4th judge. I can represent the engineering perspective.

4. Hackathon idea from my team: we're thinking about building a natural language query interface for the supply chain dashboard. Something like "show me all shipping lanes from Shanghai where delivery time exceeded SLA by more than 24 hours in the last 30 days" and it translates to the appropriate API calls. Early prototype looks promising.

To: Marcus Webb <m.webb@nextera.io>
Subject: RE: Hackathon Logistics + Rec Engine v3 Launch Prep

Marcus,

K8s migration prep is on track. A few updates:

1. Infrastructure readiness verification completed this morning. All 94 EC2 instances are mapped to their K8s deployment equivalents. The EKS cluster in us-west-2 is provisioned and the node autoscaler is configured.

2. Database migration: no changes needed. RDS instances remain unchanged — only the compute layer is migrating. This significantly reduces risk.

3. DNS cutover: we're using blue-green deployment with weighted DNS routing. Traffic will be shifted 10% → 25% → 50% → 75% → 100% over the migration window, with health checks at each step.

4. Customer notification: I verified with Amanda that the maintenance window email was sent to all customers on January 24. Zero customer inquiries received so far.

5. For the hackathon — I unfortunately can't judge (on-call for K8s post-migration monitoring). But Kevin Orosco mentioned he'd be willing to serve as the 5th judge.

6. Cost savings estimate: based on our staging environment data, the K8s migration will reduce our monthly AWS compute bill from approximately $350K to $210K — a 40% reduction. Annualized savings: $1.68M. This alone pays for the migration effort multiple times over.

LATE JANUARY ALL-HANDS MEETING TRANSCRIPT

Date: January 27, 2025
Format: In-person (main auditorium) + Zoom
Attendees: 348 in-person, 58 remote (406 total)
Duration: 50 minutes
Recording: Available on intranet

[MEETING BEGINS]

DAVID ALDRIC (CEO): Good afternoon, Nextera. Welcome to the late January all-hands. I want to cover a lot of ground today, so let's dive in.

First — the numbers. We are in the strongest position this company has ever been. Revenue is growing, customers love us, and our product roadmap is the most ambitious in our history. January bookings are tracking ahead of plan, with $4.8M in new bookings through the 27th against a monthly target of $4.2M. That's our best January ever.

Let me bring up Priya for the financial highlights.

PRIYA VASQUEZ (CFO): Thank you, David. January is looking like a strong month. Revenue is tracking at approximately $10.4M for the month, about 4% above our plan of $10.0M. Cash position is healthy at $27.1M. Operating expenses are within budget at $8.8M for the month. We have approximately 24 months of runway at current burn rates, and our burn rate is declining as we approach the breakeven trajectory in Q4.

The FY2025 operating plan is fully funded and we do not anticipate the need for any additional financing. Our pipeline coverage ratio is healthy at 3.2x and the business is performing well across all dimensions.

DAVID ALDRIC: Thank you, Priya. Marcus, hackathon and rec engine update.

MARCUS WEBB (VP Engineering): Quick updates. The engineering hackathon is February 7-8. Twenty-three teams have registered, 92 participants. We have $15K in prizes and I'm excited to see what you all build. Theme is "supply chain intelligence for everyone."

On rec engine v3 — the beta performance is exceptional. Throughput is 15% above target and p99 latency is 220ms against our 300ms target. We're on track for the February 14 launch. All 3,350 tests are passing with zero P1 or P2 bugs.

And on the K8s migration — production cutover starts next week, February 3 through 7. The main event is February 5 at 2 AM. Lisa Chen's platform team has this well in hand. Rollback plan tested three times, zero downtime expected.

DAVID ALDRIC: Thank you, Marcus. Hannah, Axion Labs update.

HANNAH CHOI (VP Product): The Axion Labs evaluation is in its second week and the results continue to be strong. Week 1 showed latency of 180ms average, 99.7% uptime, and significantly broader data coverage than our current providers — 340 shipping lanes versus 220. This week we're running load tests and doing a deep data quality analysis.

If the Week 2 results hold up, we'll be moving toward a formal partnership discussion. I'm visiting their Austin office the first week of February with Ben Arujo to discuss partnership terms.

The Axion partnership, if we proceed, would be a significant upgrade to our analytics platform's data layer. It's purely a product investment — better data means better analytics for our customers.

DAVID ALDRIC: Thank you, Hannah. Now I want to address something directly.

I get asked this a lot, so let me be direct: Nextera is not for sale. We are building a company that will define supply chain intelligence for the next decade. Full stop.

I know there's been chatter — there always is in enterprise software. Companies get acquired every week. But Nextera is not one of those companies. We have $27 million in the bank. We have no debt. We have 218 customers who trust us with their most critical operations. We have the best engineering team in supply chain intelligence.

I see us as a $1B ARR platform company. Independent. Category-defining. That's the company I'm building. And that's the company every single one of you is building alongside me.

Now let me take some questions.

[Q&A SESSION — 8 QUESTIONS]

EMPLOYEE (Engineering): David, what's your 10-year vision for Nextera?

DAVID ALDRIC: I see us as a $1B ARR platform company. Independent. Category-defining. That's the company I'm building.

In 10 years, I want Nextera to be the platform that every major supply chain on earth runs through. Not just analytics — full supply chain orchestration, prediction, and optimization. We're at $120M ARR today. I believe we can get to $500M in five years and $1B in eight to ten years through a combination of organic growth, product expansion, and strategic partnerships like the one we're evaluating with Axion Labs.

The supply chain intelligence market is massive and underpenetrated. Most companies are still running their supply chains on spreadsheets and legacy ERPs. We're building the future. And the future is ours for the taking.

EMPLOYEE (Sales): Kevin isn't here — can you comment on the competitive landscape?

DAVID ALDRIC: Sure. We compete primarily against Palantir in enterprise and Kinaxis in the manufacturing vertical. Our win rate against Palantir is 62% and rising. Our differentiation is product — specifically the recommendation engine, which nobody else has at our level of sophistication. The Axion data partnership will further strengthen our competitive position by giving our customers access to the broadest and highest-quality logistics data in the market.

I'm not worried about competition. I'm focused on building the best product. When you build the best product, customers find you.

EMPLOYEE (Product): Are there plans for international expansion?

DAVID ALDRIC: Not in the near term. Our customers are global — Maersk, DB Schenker, Kuehne+Nagel are all international companies — but our go-to-market motion is US-based with international expansion through channel partnerships. We may look at opening a European sales office in 2026 or 2027, but it's not a priority for this year.

EMPLOYEE (Engineering): What happens to our equity if the company goes public?

DAVID ALDRIC: Good question. An IPO is not on our near-term radar. I've said this publicly and I'll say it again here — we want to get to $200M ARR before we even think about the public markets. That said, your equity is valuable and will become more valuable as the company grows. Our 409A valuation is $14.20 per share as of October 2024. Every quarter that we grow revenue and expand the customer base, that number goes up.

When the time comes for a liquidity event — whether that's an IPO or something else down the road — your equity will be a significant part of your total compensation. That's by design. We want everyone at Nextera to share in the value we're building together.

EMPLOYEE (HR): Vanessa, can you share any updates on the annual engagement survey?

VANESSA KLINE (VP People): Yes! The annual employee engagement survey launches March 3 and runs through March 17. It's anonymous and takes about 15 minutes. Last year's engagement score was 78 out of 100, which puts us in the top quartile for tech companies in the Bay Area. Our goal this year is 80. The survey results will be shared at the March all-hands.

EMPLOYEE (Customer Success): What's our plan for customer retention as we scale?

DAVID ALDRIC: Amanda Briggs is leading our retention strategy. The short answer is: we invest heavily in customer success. Our net revenue retention is 119% — that means on average, existing customers are spending 19% more each year. Our CSM-to-account ratio is 1:12 for enterprise and we're hiring to bring it down to 1:10. We're also investing in self-service capabilities so that smaller customers can get value without needing as much hands-on support.

Customer retention is existential for a SaaS company. If you don't retain and expand your customers, nothing else matters. We take it seriously.

EMPLOYEE (Engineering): Marcus, will the hackathon projects ever ship as real features?

MARCUS WEBB: Great question. Last year's hackathon produced three projects that went through formal product evaluation, and one of them — the anomaly detection module in the supply chain dashboard — is now in production. This year, the first-place team gets a fast-track product evaluation, which means Hannah's team will assess the project for product-market fit within 30 days of the hackathon. So yes, your hackathon project could become a real Nextera feature.

EMPLOYEE (Finance): Can we get more transparency into departmental budgets?

DAVID ALDRIC: Fair ask. Priya publishes quarterly financial updates to the executive team and I share highlights at all-hands. Department budgets are managed by each VP with oversight from finance. If you want more detail about your specific department's budget, talk to your VP — they should be able to share the high-level allocation. We're not going to publish detailed budgets company-wide because some of that information is competitively sensitive, but we believe in transparency within the chain of command.

DAVID ALDRIC: One more thing before we wrap. I want to recognize some people.

First, the platform team — Lisa Chen, Tyler Kim, Amara Williams, Devi Krishnan — for the flawless staging migration. Zero customer impact. That's how you execute.

Second, the rec engine team — Sami Okoro, Raj Patel, Carlos Rivera, Fatima Al-Rashid — for delivering beta performance that exceeded every target we set. When you over-deliver by 15% on throughput, that's not luck. That's engineering excellence.

Third, Kevin's sales team for the three new enterprise logos in January. Maersk, DB Schenker, and Kuehne+Nagel are exactly the kind of customers that define our market position.

And finally, Vanessa's People Team for another outstanding new hire orientation. Twelve new teammates, zero friction, great feedback from the cohort. That's the Nextera standard.

You are all building something extraordinary. Don't lose sight of that. The work you do every day — every line of code, every customer call, every deal closed, every new hire onboarded — it all adds up to something bigger than any one of us.

That's all the time we have. Thank you, everyone. Next all-hands is February 24. Let's finish January strong.

Aldric wore a Nextera-branded jacket during the presentation.

NEXTERA SOLUTIONS
INFORMATION SECURITY BULLETIN

To: All Nextera Employees
From: Frank Gutierrez, Chief Information Security Officer
Date: January 27, 2025
Re: Mandatory Annual Security Awareness Training

MANDATORY TRAINING NOTICE

Annual security awareness training is now available on KnowBe4. You have until February 14 to complete it. This is mandatory — no exceptions.

The training is required for all employees regardless of role, department, or tenure. Completion is tracked at the individual level and will be reported to the Board of Directors as part of our SOC 2 Type II audit preparation.

TRAINING MODULES

The 2025 security awareness training consists of four modules:

Module 1: Phishing and Social Engineering (15 minutes)
- Updated scenarios reflecting current threat landscape
- Examples include: fake vendor invoice emails, spoofed executive requests, LinkedIn-based pretexting
- Interactive quiz at the end (minimum 80% to pass)

Module 2: Data Handling and Classification (10 minutes)
- Review of Nextera's data classification framework:
  - Public: marketing materials, public blog posts
  - Internal: all-hands slides, team meeting notes, general Slack conversations
  - Confidential: financial data, customer data, product roadmaps, employee compensation
  - Restricted: board minutes, legal privileged communications, security incident details
- Proper handling procedures for each classification level
- When and how to use encryption

Module 3: Password Hygiene and Multi-Factor Authentication (10 minutes)
- Password requirements: minimum 16 characters, unique per service
- Required MFA for all Nextera systems (Okta SSO with hardware key or authenticator app)
- Password manager recommendations (1Password provided by company)
- What to do if you suspect credential compromise

Module 4: Social Engineering Awareness (10 minutes)
- Voice phishing (vishing) scenarios
- Physical security awareness
- Tailgating prevention
- USB drop attacks
- Deepfake awareness (new for 2025)

Estimated total time: 45 minutes

ACCESS THE TRAINING

Log in to KnowBe4 at https://training.knowbe4.com using your Nextera SSO credentials. The training modules are listed under "2025 Required Training." You must complete all four modules and pass each quiz with a score of 80% or higher.

COMPLETION TIMELINE

- Training available: January 27, 2025
- Manager notification for non-completion: February 7, 2025
- VP notification for non-completion: February 12, 2025
- Completion deadline: February 14, 2025
- Board reporting: March 3, 2025 (part of SOC 2 audit preparation)

Last year we had 97% completion by deadline. Let's hit 100% this year. Your managers will be notified of non-completion.

PHISHING SIMULATION

Following the training, we will conduct a phishing simulation campaign in February. The simulation will use realistic scenarios tailored to each department (engineering will see fake GitHub and CI/CD alerts, sales will see fake CRM notifications, etc.). Results will be aggregated by department — individual results are confidential.

Last year's phishing simulation click rate: 4.2% (industry average for our peer group: 6.8%). Our target for 2025: below 3%.

If you click on a simulated phishing email, you will be redirected to a learning page — it's a teaching moment, not a punishment. However, repeated failures may result in additional targeted training.

CONTACT

For questions about the training or general security inquiries, reach out to the security team via #security-compliance on Slack or email security@nextera.io.

INCIDENT RESPONSE REMINDER

While we're on the topic of security, a reminder about our incident response procedures:

If you identify a potential security incident (suspicious email, unauthorized access, data exposure, etc.):
1. Do NOT attempt to investigate on your own
2. Report immediately to security@nextera.io or call the security hotline at x4911
3. Preserve any evidence (screenshots, email headers, etc.)
4. Do not forward suspicious emails — use the "Report Phishing" button in Outlook/Gmail

Our incident response SLA:
- Critical (data breach, active intrusion): 15-minute response, 1-hour initial assessment
- High (suspected compromise, malware detection): 1-hour response
- Medium (policy violation, unusual activity): 4-hour response
- Low (informational, best practice questions): next business day

In FY2024, we had zero critical security incidents, one high-severity incident (an employee's personal device was compromised — not connected to Nextera systems), and four medium-severity incidents (all policy violations that were resolved through additional training).

Our security posture is strong, but it requires everyone's participation. Security is not just the security team's job — it's everyone's job.

UPCOMING SECURITY EVENTS

- February 7: CrowdStrike penetration test kickoff call
- February 10-14: Penetration test execution (staging environment)
- February 14: Security awareness training deadline
- February 17-21: Phishing simulation campaign
- March 3-21: SOC 2 Type II audit (Ernst & Young)

Please mark your calendars and plan accordingly. The SOC 2 audit is our most important compliance milestone of the year and strong training completion rates contribute to a clean audit opinion.

Thank you for your attention to security. Together, we keep Nextera and our customers safe.
