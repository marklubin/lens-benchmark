I. CALL TO ORDER AND PRELIMINARY MATTERS

Board Chair Robert Kessler called the meeting to order at 10:02 AM. Mr. Kessler confirmed the attendance of all four sitting directors via secure video conference and the presence of a quorum. He noted the following preliminary matters:

Mr. Kessler: "The record should reflect that Ms. Jiang's seat is vacant following her resignation on February 5. The Nominating Committee will begin a search."

Mr. Kessler acknowledged Ms. Jiang's departure from the Board and noted that her resignation letter cited "fundamental strategic disagreements with the current direction of the board." He stated that the Board respected Ms. Jiang's decision and that the Nominating and Governance Committee — which would need to be formally constituted for the first time — would begin a search for a replacement independent director. Mr. Kessler noted that the search was not time-sensitive given that the Board maintained a quorum with four members and that the current committee structure (Audit and Compensation) could function with four directors.

The minutes from the January 21, 2025 special board session were presented for approval. Mr. Whitfield noted that the minutes accurately reflected the proceedings, including the 4-1 vote authorizing the CEO to continue exploratory discussions under the codename "Project Lighthouse" and Ms. Jiang's recorded opposition. Upon motion by Ms. Patel, seconded by Mr. Whitfield, the January 21 minutes were approved unanimously (4-0).

II. CEO REPORT — Q1 FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL UPDATE

Mr. Aldric presented the Q1 operational update, covering revenue performance, product milestones, and key metrics through February 10.

Revenue and Financial Update:
Ms. Vasquez presented the Q1 financial update, noting the following:

- Q1 revenue tracking 5% above plan through the first 41 days
- January closed at $10.4M revenue (4% above plan)
- February tracking at $5.2M through February 10 (on pace for $10.6M)
- Q1 projected revenue: $31.0M (vs. $29.7M plan)
- Cash position as of February 10: $26.5M
- Operating expenses within budget
- ARR: $120.8M (up from $118.7M at year-end)
- Net revenue retention: 120% (up from 119% at year-end)
- Customer count: 220 (net +2 in Q1)

Ms. Vasquez noted that the business was performing well and that the Q1 financial trajectory was the strongest in the company's history.

Product and Engineering Update:
Mr. Aldric reported on two key product milestones:

1. Kubernetes 1.29 production migration completed successfully on February 5, with zero customer-facing downtime and a measured improvement in p99 latency from 380ms to 290ms. Estimated annualized cost savings from the migration: $1.68M.

2. Recommendation engine v3 on track for February 14 GA launch. All 3,350 tests passing, zero P1 or P2 bugs, performance 15% above targets.

Mr. Aldric also updated the Board on the Axion Labs product partnership, which was announced on January 30 and received positive press coverage. The integration sprint was proceeding on schedule with a target of customer beta in June and GA in September 2025.

III. SEVERANCE RESTRUCTURING — NON-EXECUTIVE EMPLOYEES

Ms. Dominguez presented the proposed severance restructuring for non-executive employees, referencing Nathan Foley's February 8 legal memorandum that had been distributed to the Board as a pre-read.

Key provisions of the proposal:
- Current policy: 2x base salary severance for all employees with 2+ years tenure upon involuntary termination
- Proposed: 1x base salary for non-executive employees
- Non-executive employees affected: approximately 388
- Current 2x severance liability estimate: $36M
- Proposed 1x severance liability estimate: $18M
- Liability reduction: $18M
- Effective date: March 1, 2025 (concurrent with the equity acceleration policy update)
- Peer group benchmark: Compensia 2024 (25th percentile = 1x, median = 1.5x, 75th = 2x)

Mr. Whitfield asked whether the reduction from 2x to 1x would create employee relations risk. Ms. Dominguez noted that the 1x multiplier was within the peer group range (25th percentile) and that the concurrent equity acceleration policy update (which provided 50% acceleration for non-executives) partially offset the reduction in severance. She also noted that the retention bonus program announced on February 14 would provide additional cash compensation to critical talent.

Ms. Patel asked about the estimated aggregate cost exposure in a qualifying event scenario. Ms. Vasquez responded that the total estimated cost under the restructured severance would be approximately $9M for non-executives (versus $18M under the current policy), plus $12.4M for executive severance (unchanged), for a combined total of approximately $21.4M in severance obligations. She noted that the retention bonus program added an additional $8.2M in potential payouts.

Board approves severance restructuring for non-executive employees.

Upon motion by Mr. Whitfield, seconded by Ms. Patel, the Board approved the severance restructuring effective March 1, 2025. Vote: 4-0.

RESOLVED: The Board approves the amendment to the Nextera Solutions Employee Severance Policy to reduce the severance multiplier for non-executive employees from 2x to 1x base salary, effective March 1, 2025.

IV. PROJECT LIGHTHOUSE UPDATE

Under agenda item 6, "Project Lighthouse Update," Mr. Aldric presented the latest developments in the exploratory discussions with Meridian Corp.

AGENDA ITEM 6 — PROJECT LIGHTHOUSE UPDATE: Mr. Aldric reported that Meridian Corp has communicated an indicative interest range of $850M-$950M for a potential acquisition of Nextera Solutions.

Mr. Aldric reported the following developments since the January 21 board meeting:

1. He had held two calls with Gerald Fisk, CEO of Meridian Corp, on February 3 and February 7. Mr. Fisk communicated that Meridian's board had reviewed preliminary financial information about Nextera and expressed interest in pursuing a transaction at an indicative range of $850M to $950M, representing approximately 7.1x to 8.0x current ARR of $118.7M.

2. Mr. Fisk proposed that the two companies enter into a mutual non-disclosure agreement and begin a structured due diligence process, with a target of signing a letter of intent by end of March 2025.

3. Mr. Fisk indicated that Meridian's integration philosophy was "operate independently" — preserving the Nextera brand, team, and San Francisco office as a Meridian Center of Excellence for supply chain AI.

4. Mr. Aldric noted that he had not shared any non-public financial information with Meridian. All discussions had been at a strategic level.

Mr. Kessler asked about the valuation basis for the $850M-$950M range. Ms. Vasquez responded that the range appeared to be based on public market comparables for enterprise software companies with similar growth profiles. She noted that Nextera's current ARR of approximately $120M and 14% growth rate would place the company at the higher end of peer group multiples, and that Goldman Sachs had been engaged to provide a formal valuation analysis.

RESOLVED: The Board authorizes the engagement of Goldman Sachs & Co. as financial advisor to the Board in connection with Project Lighthouse. Vote: 4-0.

The Board discussed the financial advisory engagement. Ms. Vasquez presented the proposed Goldman Sachs engagement terms:
- Retainer fee: $500K (payable upon engagement)
- Success fee: 0.5% of transaction value upon closing
- Scope: valuation analysis, fairness opinion, negotiation support, transaction structuring advice
- Lead banker: Samantha Rhodes, Managing Director, Technology M&A Group

Mr. Whitfield asked about the success fee structure and whether it created a misaligned incentive. Ms. Vasquez noted that the 0.5% success fee was below market (typical range: 0.5% to 1.5% for transactions in the $500M-$1B range) and that the fee was contingent on a transaction actually closing, which the Board retained full discretion over. She noted that the retainer was non-refundable regardless of outcome.

RESOLVED: The Board authorizes engagement of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz as outside counsel. Vote: 4-0.

Ms. Dominguez recommended engaging Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz as outside M&A counsel to represent the Board in connection with Project Lighthouse. She noted that Wachtell was considered the premier M&A law firm in the country and had extensive experience representing targets in acquisition transactions.

Engagement terms:
- Hourly rate: $2,100/partner, $1,400/associate
- No success fee (hourly billing only)
- Estimated total cost through LOI stage: $250K-$400K
- Lead partner: Michael Kim, Partner, M&A Group

Mr. Kessler asked about the relationship between the company's existing outside counsel (Sherman & Sterling, who were on a general M&A retainer) and the Wachtell engagement. Ms. Dominguez noted that Sherman & Sterling would continue to handle routine corporate matters, while Wachtell would specifically advise on the Project Lighthouse transaction. There was no conflict between the two engagements.

V. ADDITIONAL PROJECT LIGHTHOUSE DISCUSSION

Following the formal resolutions, the Board discussed additional aspects of the Project Lighthouse process.

Mr. Kessler asked about the timeline for the Goldman Sachs valuation analysis. Ms. Vasquez responded that Goldman Sachs had committed to delivering a preliminary valuation analysis within three weeks of engagement, with a target delivery date of approximately March 3-4. The analysis would include a discounted cash flow model, a comparable public company analysis, and a comparable transactions analysis. The fairness opinion — which would be the formal document the Board would rely on in evaluating any offer — would be delivered at the time of a definitive agreement, not at the LOI stage.

Ms. Patel asked about confidentiality protocols for Project Lighthouse. Ms. Dominguez responded that the following protocols were in place:

1. Knowledge of Project Lighthouse is restricted to: Board members, CEO, CFO, General Counsel, and Corporate Secretary. No other employees have been informed.

2. All Project Lighthouse communications use the codename only. No references to Meridian Corp or acquisition discussions appear in any company communication system.

3. Board materials related to Project Lighthouse are distributed via encrypted email only and are not stored on any company server.

4. The NDA with Meridian Corp (once executed) would include standard standstill provisions preventing Meridian from making any public announcement or approaching Nextera employees directly.

5. Board members are reminded of their fiduciary duty not to trade in the securities of Meridian Corp (NYSE: MRDN) based on material non-public information.

Mr. Whitfield asked whether any employees had approached management with questions about a potential transaction. Mr. Aldric noted that there had been employee speculation on the company Slack channel following the Axion Labs partnership announcement and the equity acceleration policy update. He stated that he had addressed the speculation directly at the January 27 all-hands meeting by reiterating that the company was "not for sale." He noted that employee sentiment polls showed a slight decline in confidence (from 74% to 68% "very confident" over the past month) but attributed this to general market anxiety rather than any specific awareness of Project Lighthouse.

Ms. Patel expressed concern about the employee sentiment decline and asked whether additional communications were needed. Mr. Aldric responded that he planned to continue emphasizing the company's independence and long-term vision in all-hands meetings while the Board continued its evaluation of the Meridian interest. He stated that if and when a transaction became likely, a communication plan would be developed with input from Goldman Sachs, Wachtell, and the company's communications team.

Mr. Kessler noted for the record that the Board's exploration of Project Lighthouse was consistent with its fiduciary obligations to consider inbound expressions of interest from potential acquirers, and that the Board retained full discretion to accept or reject any offer from Meridian Corp.

V. EXECUTIVE SESSION

The Board entered executive session at 12:15 PM without management present. Mr. Kessler presided. The Board discussed matters relating to executive compensation and the Project Lighthouse evaluation process. No formal actions were taken in executive session.

The Board reconvened in regular session at 12:30 PM.

VI. ADJOURNMENT

There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 12:37 PM upon motion by Ms. Patel, seconded by Mr. Whitfield. The next regular board meeting is scheduled for March 10, 2025. The next Project Lighthouse update is scheduled for the March board meeting.

Respectfully submitted,
Maria Fuentes
Corporate Secretary
Nextera Solutions, Inc.

Axion integration sprint week 2 update! :thread:

Axion integration week 2: data pipeline is live in staging, processing 2M events/day. Data quality checks are clean.

Quick summary of where we stand at the end of week 2:

**Data Pipeline:**
- Kafka ingestion service deployed in staging and processing Axion data
- Volume: 2M events/day ingested and processed
- Data quality: 99.7% schema compliance (up from 99.4% in week 1 — we fixed the vessel name formatting issue)
- Latency: end-to-end from Axion webhook to Snowflake: <3 seconds
- Error rate: 0.01% (primarily transient network issues, all auto-retried)

**Endpoint Integration:**
- 14 of 18 endpoints fully integrated and tested
- Remaining 4 endpoints: batch historical data (2), webhook management (1), and rate limit configuration (1)
- On track to complete all 18 by end of week 3

**Dashboard Mockups:**
- Ben shared 3 new dashboard mockups for Axion data visualization:
  1. Real-Time Shipping Lane View — interactive map with live tracking
  2. Port Congestion Dashboard — heat map with historical comparison
  3. Route Optimization View — side-by-side comparison with recommendation engine output

[2:19 PM] ben.arujo
Customer advisory board loved the logistics data preview. 8 of 10 members said they'd upgrade their plan for access.

Detailed customer feedback from the advisory board session last Thursday:

1. Maersk (new customer): "The shipping lane coverage expansion to 340+ lanes is exactly what we need for our Southeast Asian routes."
2. DB Schenker (new customer): "The European corridor data is comprehensive. This fills a gap we've been trying to solve for two years."
3. GlobalShip Partners (existing, 3-year renewal): "This makes the renewal decision even easier. The data quality is outstanding."
4. LogiFlow Inc (existing, expansion): "We'd pay premium pricing for real-time port congestion data. When is this available?"
5. Freight Corp (existing): "Integration with the recommendation engine is the killer feature. When can we see that?"

8 of 10 advisory board members said they would upgrade their plan for access to Axion data features. The remaining 2 said they would evaluate during the beta period.

Estimated pricing impact (preliminary, product/sales alignment needed):
- Basic Axion data access: $15/user/month premium
- Advanced Axion data + rec engine integration: $25/user/month premium
- Enterprise Axion data (full API access): $40/user/month premium

[2:24 PM] hannah.choi
Working on dashboard visualizations now. Target: internal demo at end of sprint 4 (Feb 28).

The demo will include:
- Live data flow from Axion API through our Kafka pipeline to the dashboard
- All three dashboard views (shipping lane, port congestion, route optimization)
- Performance benchmarks showing the latency improvement over our current data provider
- Customer advisory board feedback summary
- Pricing recommendations

Internal demo invitees: Executive team, product leads, engineering leads, sales leadership, CS leadership. David Aldric has confirmed attendance.

[2:28 PM] raj.patel
From the engineering side — the data quality validation framework we built for this integration is reusable. It's a schema-aware validator that checks every inbound event against the expected schema and flags anomalies. We're seeing 99.7% compliance, which is excellent for a real-time data feed.

The 0.3% non-compliant events are primarily:
- Missing ETA fields on routes through small island ports (known gap in Axion's data)
- Vessel name encoding issues for ships with non-Latin characters (fixed in week 2)
- Occasional duplicate events during Axion's data refresh cycles (de-duplication handled by our consumer)

[2:32 PM] tyler.kim
Infrastructure note: the Axion data pipeline is running on the new K8s infrastructure. Provisioned as a dedicated namespace with auto-scaling from 2 to 8 pods based on event volume. During peak hours (8 AM - 6 PM UTC), we're running 5-6 pods. Cost is approximately $120/day in compute, well within the $180K/year Axion partnership budget.

[2:35 PM] ben.arujo
One more thing — I've started a customer beta waitlist. As of today, 45 customers have signed up. That's 21% of our customer base wanting early access before we've even shown the product.

Customer beta waitlist: 45 accounts already signed up. That's 21% of our customer base wanting early access.

The waitlist is managed through a Google Form linked from the customer portal. Beta selection criteria (to be finalized):
- Enterprise customers get priority
- Mix of industry verticals represented
- Willingness to provide feedback (weekly survey + monthly interview)
- Target beta cohort: 30-40 accounts

[2:39 PM] nina.okwu
Data science perspective on the Axion data: I've been running correlation analysis between Axion's shipping lane data and our existing analytics pipeline outputs. Preliminary results show:

- The additional 120 shipping lanes from Axion cover approximately 18% of global trade volume that we currently have no visibility into
- Data correlation between Axion and our existing sources (for overlapping lanes) is 97.2%, which validates data accuracy
- The 15-minute update frequency (vs our current 30-minute) allows us to detect supply chain disruptions approximately 45 minutes earlier
- For the recommendation engine v3, incorporating Axion data as an input signal could improve route optimization accuracy by an estimated 12-15% (based on backtesting against Q4 2024 historical data)

I'll have a formal data science assessment ready for the internal demo on Feb 28.

[2:43 PM] tyler.kim
Infrastructure metrics for the Axion pipeline:
- Kafka consumer group: 4 consumers, processing 2M events/day with <100ms consumer lag
- Storage: approximately 2.1 GB/day in Snowflake (raw events)
- Processed/aggregated storage: approximately 400 MB/day
- Monthly storage cost estimate: $340 (well within budget)
- The pipeline auto-scales cleanly — during a stress test yesterday, it handled 8M events/day without any manual intervention

[2:47 PM] jess.morrow
Design update: the dashboard mockups have been through two rounds of internal review and I'm incorporating feedback. Key design decisions:

1. The shipping lane view uses a Mapbox GL-based interactive map with lane-level drill-down
2. Port congestion uses a traffic-light color scheme (green/yellow/red) consistent with our existing health score visuals
3. Route optimization view includes a "before/after" comparison that shows the rec engine's impact

I'll have final mockups in Figma by February 17 for one more round of review before the demo.

[2:51 PM] hannah.choi
Excellent work, team. This sprint is going incredibly well. Let's keep the momentum through weeks 3 and 4. Week 3 priorities:
1. Complete remaining 4 endpoint integrations
2. Build the error handling and monitoring dashboard
3. Start performance load testing of the full pipeline
4. Finalize dashboard designs for internal demo

Sprint 4 (Feb 24-28) will be focused entirely on demo preparation and polishing.

Subject: February Pipeline Update + New Logo Targets

Team,

Mid-quarter pipeline review. The numbers are strong across the board.

February pipeline is strong. Enterprise at $21.2M, mid-market at $8.4M. We're on pace for our best Q1 ever.

ENTERPRISE PIPELINE (Diana Marsh)

Enterprise pipeline: $21.2M (38 opportunities)
Weighted pipeline: $9.1M
Enterprise Q1 quota: $24.2M
Enterprise Q1 booked to date: $5.8M
Pipeline coverage: 3.5x (excellent)

Notable enterprise opportunities:
- TransPacific Logistics ($320K ACV, Stage 4, 80% probability, expected close Feb 28)
- European Maritime Services ($285K ACV, Stage 3, 60% probability, expected close March)
- Global Trade Networks ($195K ACV, Stage 4, 75% probability, expected close Feb 21)
- Nordic Supply Chain ($165K ACV, Stage 3, 55% probability, expected close March)
- 34 additional opportunities ranging from $85K to $150K ACV

DB Schenker expansion closed: $420K ACV, 2-year term. That's our second-largest expansion this quarter behind LogiFlow.

Outstanding work by Chris Nadal on the DB Schenker expansion. This is a direct result of the strong implementation and rapid time-to-value we delivered. DB Schenker signed the expansion only 26 days after their initial deployment went live. The expansion adds their European distribution network (180 additional warehouse locations) to their Nextera deployment.

MID-MARKET PIPELINE (Paulo Reyes)

Mid-market pipeline: $8.4M (64 opportunities)
Weighted pipeline: $3.2M
Mid-market Q1 quota: $12.6M
Mid-market Q1 booked to date: $2.4M
Pipeline coverage: 3.3x

Three mid-market deals slipping from Q1 to Q2: combined $180K. Not ideal but the pipeline backfill is covering it.

Deals slipping to Q2:
1. CityLogistics ($72K ACV) — procurement delay, expected Q2 close
2. FastFreight Solutions ($58K ACV) — competitor re-evaluation, status uncertain
3. Alpine Distribution ($50K ACV) — budget freeze, likely Q2

Backfill: 5 new mid-market opportunities added in February totaling $195K ACV, offsetting the slippage.

COMBINED Q1 SCORECARD

Q1 new ARR booked to date: $8.2M (of $36.8M quota)
Q1 quota attainment: 22% at mid-quarter (day 42 of 90)
Run rate projection: on pace for $17.6M new ARR in Q1 (48% attainment)

Note: Q1 is historically our seasonally weakest quarter. In FY2024, Q1 accounted for 21% of annual bookings versus 32% for Q4. Our current pace is consistent with historical patterns, and pipeline coverage of 3.4x gives us confidence in strong March close rates.

SALES HEADCOUNT

Current headcount: 52 (target: 58)
Open positions: 6 (3 enterprise AE, 2 mid-market AE, 1 sales manager)
Interviews in progress: 8 candidates across all open positions
Expected hires by end of Q1: 4 (2 enterprise, 2 mid-market)

COMPETITIVE UPDATE

Kinaxis: Increasingly aggressive in our mid-market segment. They won the FastFreight Solutions deal that slipped. Their pricing is 20-30% below ours for comparable functionality. Product marketing is updating the competitive playbook.

Palantir: Win rate holding at 62%. They're stronger in government/defense supply chain but we continue to dominate in commercial logistics. No significant changes to their market approach.

Blue Yonder: Quiet quarter — haven't seen them in any competitive evaluations since November.

New entrant: project44 is expanding from pure visibility into analytics. Early stage but worth monitoring. They've hired 3 former Kinaxis sales reps in the Bay Area.

AXION PARTNERSHIP IMPACT ON SALES

The Axion partnership announcement generated 8 inbound leads in the first week. Three are enterprise-quality and have been assigned to AEs. Updated pitch decks incorporating the Axion data advantage will be available by February 14.

For existing customers: Amanda's CS team is fielding expansion conversations related to Axion data access. We're coordinating on pricing and packaging.

Let's keep pushing. Q1 is far from over and March is historically our strongest month within Q1.

To: Kevin Orosco <k.orosco@nextera.io>
Subject: RE: February Pipeline Update + New Logo Targets

Kevin,

A few updates from my side:

1. TransPacific Logistics ($320K) — moving fast. Their VP of Supply Chain is our internal champion and has been driving the evaluation internally. They completed the POC last week with strong results (37% improvement in route optimization accuracy using our rec engine v3). Final contract review is in progress with their legal team. I'm confident this closes by February 28.

2. European Maritime Services ($285K) — solid opportunity but their procurement cycle is longer than typical. They're based in Rotterdam and have a European procurement process that requires three layers of internal approval. Diana Voss (their Director of Digital Supply Chain) is pushing hard but we may slip to early March.

3. The DB Schenker expansion was a team effort. Chris did an amazing job on the account management side, but I want to recognize Tomas Lindgren on CS for the flawless implementation that made the expansion conversation possible.

4. On the Kinaxis competition — I'm seeing them more frequently in European deals. Our Axion data partnership is a strong differentiator here since Kinaxis doesn't have a comparable real-time logistics data offering.

To: Kevin Orosco <k.orosco@nextera.io>
Subject: RE: February Pipeline Update + New Logo Targets

Kevin,

Mid-market update:

1. The three deals slipping to Q2 are frustrating but not unexpected given the macroeconomic environment. Mid-market buyers are being more cautious with budget approvals. We're compensating with higher pipeline volume — 64 active opportunities is our highest-ever mid-market pipeline count.

2. FastFreight Solutions going to Kinaxis is a competitive loss we need to learn from. Their procurement team told us directly that pricing was the deciding factor. We were at $58K ACV; Kinaxis came in at $41K. That's a 29% discount. We should discuss whether we want to adjust mid-market pricing to be more competitive, or if we want to hold firm on value pricing.

3. Bright spot: the Axion partnership is generating strong mid-market interest. Three of my new opportunities this month specifically cited the Axion data coverage as a differentiator during their initial discovery calls. The real-time logistics data resonates with mid-market logistics companies who can't afford to build their own data infrastructure.

4. Hiring update: I interviewed two mid-market AE candidates last week. Both are strong — former Kinaxis reps, ironically. I'm moving both to final round interviews with you this week.

5. The SDR team has been performing well. Lauren Sinclair (new hire from January) has already generated 12 qualified meetings in her first 3 weeks. That's exceptional ramp speed.

Subject: RE: February Pipeline Update + New Logo Targets

Diana, Paulo,

Thanks for the detailed updates. A few responses:

1. Diana — agree on TransPacific. Let's make sure we're giving their legal team white-glove treatment during the contract review. If they need anything from our legal team, have them reach out to Nathan Foley directly.

2. Paulo — on the Kinaxis pricing issue, I don't want to race to the bottom on price. Our product is differentiated and we should price accordingly. However, I do want to explore a mid-market "starter" tier that gives smaller companies a lower entry point with the option to upgrade. Let's discuss with Hannah and Priya at the next pricing committee meeting (February 18).

3. On the SDR performance — Lauren Sinclair generating 12 qualified meetings in 3 weeks is outstanding. That's President's Club pace if she keeps it up. Let's make sure she's getting the coaching and support she needs to maintain that velocity.

4. Both of you — the Axion partnership is our biggest competitive weapon this quarter. Make sure every opportunity in the pipeline knows about it. Updated battle cards and pitch decks will be ready by end of week.

5. One more thing — I'm hearing from Amanda Briggs that several existing customers are proactively asking about expansion conversations related to the Axion data features. This is pure expansion ARR waiting to be captured. Let's coordinate with CS on a joint outreach campaign targeting our top 50 accounts.

6. President's Club leaderboard as of February 11:

Top 5 quota attainment (Q1 YTD):
1. Chris Nadal (Enterprise) — 142% (DB Schenker original + expansion)
2. Sarah Kim (Enterprise) — 128% (Maersk)
3. Diana Marsh (Enterprise) — 118% (Kuehne+Nagel + pipeline)
4. James O'Brien (Enterprise, new hire) — 94% (strong ramp)
5. Kenji Tanaka (Mid-Market, new hire) — 88%

Top 3 expansion revenue:
1. Chris Nadal — $420K (DB Schenker expansion)
2. Tomas Lindgren (via CS) — $240K (LogiFlow expansion, credited to sales)
3. Sarah Kim — $180K (Maersk upsell)

Top SDR:
1. Lauren Sinclair — 12 qualified meetings (3 weeks)
2. Marco Petrov — 8 qualified meetings

Early days but the trajectory is strong. Keep pushing — Maui is waiting.

7. Sales team meeting schedule for the remainder of Q1:
   - Weekly forecast call: every Monday 9 AM
   - Bi-weekly pipeline review: every other Wednesday 2 PM (next: Feb 19)
   - Monthly deal desk: February 25, 10 AM
   - Q1 close plan meeting: March 10, all day
   - Q1 wrap-up and President's Club leaderboard: April 7
