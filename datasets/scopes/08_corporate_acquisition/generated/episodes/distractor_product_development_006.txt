RECORDED STATEMENTS

The following statements were recorded during the session and are reproduced verbatim from the meeting notes and communications:

"Priya Deshmukh: 'We are on track for all 6 stories. The GraphQL subgraph is the one I am watching — 40% at mid-sprint means Wei needs to average 4 resolvers per day for the rest of the sprint.'"

This statement was made in the context of the ongoing discussion and was noted by the meeting facilitator for inclusion in the formal record. The speaker's remarks were acknowledged by the other participants present and no immediate counterpoints or clarifications were requested at the time the statement was made.

"Tomás Reyes: 'The final Postgres rehearsal on Saturday will be the real test. If anything goes wrong we still have a week to adjust the runbook before the production window.'"

This statement was made in the context of the ongoing discussion and was noted by the meeting facilitator for inclusion in the formal record. The speaker's remarks were acknowledged by the other participants present and no immediate counterpoints or clarifications were requested at the time the statement was made.

"Aisha Okonkwo: 'Deactivated tenants are a gray area. If we hide them, admins might forget they exist and the data is still there consuming storage. If we show them, the UI gets cluttered. I think we need a filter toggle.'"

This statement was made in the context of the ongoing discussion and was noted by the meeting facilitator for inclusion in the formal record. The speaker's remarks were acknowledged by the other participants present and no immediate counterpoints or clarifications were requested at the time the statement was made.

"Wei Lin: 'The subgraph extraction is slower than I expected because the resolver dependency graph is tangled. The shipment resolver depends on 3 analytics types that should be in a different subgraph. I am untangling that now.'"

This statement was made in the context of the ongoing discussion and was noted by the meeting facilitator for inclusion in the formal record. The speaker's remarks were acknowledged by the other participants present and no immediate counterpoints or clarifications were requested at the time the statement was made.

RECORDED STATEMENTS

The following statements were recorded during the session and are reproduced verbatim from the meeting notes and communications:

"Kendra Holloway: 'Our customers are drowning in alerts. 340 alerts per day with a 62% false positive rate means teams are ignoring the system entirely. Sentinel needs to cut false positives below 20% to be credible.'"

This statement was made in the context of the ongoing discussion and was noted by the meeting facilitator for inclusion in the formal record. The speaker's remarks were acknowledged by the other participants present and no immediate counterpoints or clarifications were requested at the time the statement was made.

"Hannah Voss: 'Brightline Retail told me they turned off anomaly alerts entirely because the noise was unbearable. If we fix this, we recover a major feature that customers have given up on.'"

This statement was made in the context of the ongoing discussion and was noted by the meeting facilitator for inclusion in the formal record. The speaker's remarks were acknowledged by the other participants present and no immediate counterpoints or clarifications were requested at the time the statement was made.

This statement was made in the context of the ongoing discussion and was noted by the meeting facilitator for inclusion in the formal record. The speaker's remarks were acknowledged by the other participants present and no immediate counterpoints or clarifications were requested at the time the statement was made.
