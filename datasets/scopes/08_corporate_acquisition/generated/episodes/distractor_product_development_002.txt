RECORDED STATEMENTS

The following statements were recorded during the session and are reproduced verbatim from the meeting notes and communications:

"Lena Marsh: 'Users from Pinnacle said they switch workspaces 12-15 times per day. The switcher has to be fast and unobtrusive — two clicks maximum.'"

This statement was made in the context of the ongoing discussion and was noted by the meeting facilitator for inclusion in the formal record. The speaker's remarks were acknowledged by the other participants present and no immediate counterpoints or clarifications were requested at the time the statement was made.

"Marcus Stein: 'The color-coded tenant badges are great for sighted users but we need a text label fallback. A user relying on a screen reader needs to know which workspace they are in without color.'"

The speaker's remarks were acknowledged by the other participants present and no immediate counterpoints or clarifications were requested at the time the statement was made.

"Aisha Okonkwo: 'I can have a working prototype in the component sandbox by end of next week. The hard part is the tenant logo lazy-loading — we do not want to block render on image fetches.'"

This statement was made in the context of the ongoing discussion and was noted by the meeting facilitator for inclusion in the formal record. The speaker's remarks were acknowledged by the other participants present and no immediate counterpoints or clarifications were requested at the time the statement was made.
