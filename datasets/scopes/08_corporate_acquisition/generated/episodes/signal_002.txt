[DAVID ALDRIC, CEO — OPENING REMARKS]

Good morning, everyone. Happy New Year. I hope you all had a wonderful holiday break and are ready to hit the ground running in 2025.

I want to start by thanking every single person in this room — and on the Zoom — for an outstanding 2024. We finished the year strong, and I couldn't be more proud of what this team has accomplished.

Let me give you the highlight reel. Q4 was our best quarter in the company's history. Revenue came in at $31.2 million, beating our target by over two percent. For the full year, we exited at $118.7 million in annual recurring revenue. That is 14 percent year-over-year growth, and it puts us in a very strong position heading into 2025.

We are building this company for the long haul. Nextera is not a flash in the pan — we are building a generational company in supply chain intelligence.

That's not just a tagline. That's our north star. Every hire we make, every feature we ship, every customer we serve — it's all in service of building something that lasts. I think that's what separates us from the noise in this market. We have a clear vision, a strong balance sheet, and a team that knows how to execute. That's a rare combination in enterprise software, and I don't take it for granted.

Before I hand it over to the team, I want to share one more thing. The board met on Monday and unanimously approved our 2025 operating plan. The revenue target is $142 million in ARR by year-end. That's approximately 20 percent growth over our current run rate. It's ambitious, absolutely, but this team has shown me time and again that ambitious is exactly where we perform best.

Now let me walk you through the key highlights from each team, and then we'll have plenty of time for questions.

[PRIYA VASQUEZ, CFO — FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS]

Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone.

I'm going to keep this brief and high-level. The detailed numbers are in the slides that will be posted to #all-hands-slides after the meeting, but here are the headlines.

Full year 2024 revenue grew 14% year over year. We exited December at $118.7 million ARR, which means we added approximately $14.5 million in net new ARR during the year. Our gross margin held steady at 78.3%, which is in line with our target range of 78 to 80 percent. I want to call that out specifically because there has been some competitive pressure in the mid-market on pricing, and the fact that we maintained margin discipline while scaling at this rate is a testament to the value proposition of our product and the discipline of our sales organization.

Cash position is strong. We ended the year with $28.4 million in cash, and we have an undrawn $15 million credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank. At our current burn rate, we have roughly two years of runway. The 2025 plan does not require any additional financing. I want to be very clear about that — we do not need to raise money. We are well-capitalized and our path to profitability is visible in the operating plan.

The board approved our 2025 operating plan on Monday. The revenue target is $142 million — that's approximately 20% growth over our current run rate. It's ambitious but achievable based on our pipeline and the investments we're making in product and go-to-market.

We're also expanding headcount from 402 to 465 by year end. That's 63 net new positions across the company. More on that from Vanessa in a moment.

On the balance sheet, I'd note that our accounts receivable position is $14.2 million with DSO of 42 days, which is within our target of 45 days. Deferred revenue is $22.8 million, the highest in company history, reflecting our shift toward annual and multi-year prepaid contracts in the enterprise segment. That deferred revenue number is important — it represents contracted revenue that is already committed and will be recognized over the coming quarters. It gives us a solid foundation heading into 2025.

EBITDA for December came in at negative $1.0 million, which is a significant improvement from negative $1.8 million in September. The trajectory is clear and we expect to reach EBITDA breakeven by Q4 of this year.

Any questions on the financials before I hand it back?

[Pause — no questions from the floor]

[MARCUS WEBB, VP ENGINEERING — PRODUCT & ENGINEERING UPDATE]

Thanks, Priya. Hey everyone.

I've got two things to share with you today, and I'm going to demo one of them.

First, the Kubernetes 1.29 migration. Lisa Chen and the platform team completed Phase 1 — staging — over the holiday break. Staging is running clean, no issues. We're planning the production migration for the first week of February, with a scheduled maintenance window on February 5 from 2 AM to 6 AM Pacific. More details will come from Lisa's team, but I wanted to give you a heads up that there will be a brief maintenance period. The engineering team has rehearsed the migration three times in staging and we're confident in the rollback procedures should anything go sideways.

Second — and this is the fun part — I want to show you what the recommendation engine v3 looks like.

[Webb shares screen, demos recommendation engine v3 beta interface. The demo shows a supply chain scenario where the engine identifies optimal routing alternatives during a simulated port disruption. The audience reacts with applause at the speed of the recommendations — sub-200ms response times on a dataset of 2 million shipment records.]

Thank you. That's the beta. We're at 94% test coverage and tracking for GA release on February 14. Raj Patel and his team have done an incredible job on this. The performance improvements over v2 are substantial — we're seeing 3x faster inference times and the model handles sparse data matrices much more gracefully. The edge case handling that Raj's team has been focused on for the last two months is really paying off. The v3 engine processes 2 million records in under 200 milliseconds, and it handles the sparse matrix scenarios that tripped up v2 without any degradation.

I also want to give a shout-out to the entire engineering team for our CI/CD pipeline pass rate last quarter: 97.2%. That's the highest in the company's history. Our target for this quarter is 98.5%. I know that sounds like a small number, but when you're running thousands of builds per week, that fraction of a percent matters. It means fewer broken builds, less time wasted on investigations, and faster time to ship.

Our engineering headcount stands at 142 out of 402 total employees. We have plans to add approximately 25 engineering positions this year, and I'll be working with Vanessa's team on the hiring timeline. Our sprint cadence is two weeks, and we kicked off Q1 Sprint 1 on Monday with 14 stories totaling 340 story points.

[Applause]

[KEVIN OROSCO, VP SALES — GO-TO-MARKET UPDATE]

Thanks, Marcus. Good morning, team.

I am very excited about where we sit heading into 2025. We closed Q4 with 14 new enterprise logos, and I want to call out three wins that I think really demonstrate the momentum we have in the market.

We won Maersk, DB Schenker, and Kuehne+Nagel. Three of the largest logistics companies in the world. Each of these deals was competitive — we went head-to-head against the incumbents and won on product. That is a testament to the work this entire company does, from Engineering to Customer Success to Marketing.

These are not small deals. These are marquee logos that will open doors to other enterprises in the transportation and logistics vertical. Our win rate against Palantir in the mid-market is now 62%, up from 54% last quarter. The product is speaking for itself.

For 2025, we have a target of 50 new enterprise logos and a pipeline that gives me confidence we'll get there. Q1 pipeline is at $18.4 million across 34 active enterprise opportunities, and we're building fast. We've also got 10 new sales reps joining in Q1 to support the growth. Currently, our sales headcount is 48, and we expect to hit 58 by end of Q1.

Let me give you a quick look at the numbers behind the wins. Average enterprise deal size is $185K ACV, and mid-market is $62K ACV. Our overall win rate is 31%, but importantly, when we get to the proof-of-concept stage, our win rate jumps to 41%. The sales cycle averages 78 days. The takeaway here is that when prospects actually see the product in action, we win far more often than we lose. Marcus, Raj, and the engineering team deserve a lot of credit for that.

More to share at the sales kickoff next week, but I wanted to give everyone a taste of the momentum.

[VANESSA KLINE, VP PEOPLE — PEOPLE UPDATE]

Thanks, Kevin. Good morning, everyone.

A couple of things from the People team.

First, we have 38 open positions across all departments. If you know great people, please refer them. Our referral bonus is $5,000 for engineering roles and $3,000 for all other roles, paid out after the new hire's 90-day mark.

We're hiring in Engineering, Sales, Customer Success, Product, Finance, and Legal. The full list is on our careers page and in the #open-roles Slack channel. I want to emphasize that we are prioritizing speed and quality in this hiring cycle. Our time-to-fill last year averaged 34 days, and I'd like to get that down to 30 for 2025. Our offer acceptance rate is 88%, which is strong, but there's always room to improve.

Second, I want to remind everyone that benefits open enrollment closes on January 20. If you haven't made your selections yet, please do so this week. We've increased the 401(k) match to 5%, which is a meaningful increase, and we've added a new dental plan through Delta Dental. The three medical plan tiers remain: Bronze at $180 per month, Silver at $320, and Gold at $510. If you have questions about the plans, the Benefits Team has office hours every day this week from 12 to 1 PM in conference room 14-C.

Third, we welcomed our first cohort of 2025 new hires this week — 12 new teammates joining across the company. Please make them feel welcome. If you've been assigned as a buddy, reach out to your new hire by end of day today. That cohort includes 6 engineers, 3 sales reps, 2 customer success team members, and 1 finance hire. Orientation runs through January 17.

A final note: our new-hire 90-day retention rate is 96%, which is a number I'm very proud of. It speaks to the quality of our hiring process and the onboarding experience this company provides. Let's keep that number up.

That's it from me. Back to you, David.

[DAVID ALDRIC — Q&A SESSION]

Thank you, Vanessa. Now let's open it up for questions. We have about 25 minutes.

[Q&A — 25 MINUTES]

Q from floor (employee, engineering): "Are we thinking about an IPO timeline?"

Aldric: "We have the luxury of being well-capitalized. An IPO is not on our near-term radar. We're focused on getting to $200M ARR before we even think about that."

I want to be crystal clear: we are independent, we intend to stay independent, and every decision we make is about building long-term value for our employees and our customers. There are no conversations happening about selling the company, going public in the near term, or anything else along those lines. Our job is to build. That's what we do.

Q from floor (employee, sales): "What's the timeline for the new sales playbooks? We're hearing a lot about Kinaxis in the mid-market and could use updated competitive positioning."

Orosco: "Good question. Product marketing is updating the competitive battle cards right now. I expect the new versions to be out by end of January. In the meantime, if you're in a competitive deal against Kinaxis, reach out to Diana Marsh — she's running point on competitive intelligence."

Q from floor (employee, customer success): "Can we get more resources for the implementation team? We're three weeks behind on the Freight Corp deployment and it's stretching the team thin."

Aldric: "Amanda, do you want to take that?"

Amanda Briggs (VP Customer Success, from floor): "Yes, we're aware of the Freight Corp situation. Their IT team has been slow on the API integration, which has pushed our timeline. We're adding a dedicated implementation engineer to that account this week. More broadly, we've budgeted for 6 new hires in Customer Success in Q1 — two of those are implementation engineers. We should be in much better shape by end of February."

Q from Zoom (employee, remote — Portland office): "When are we getting the Portland office upgrade? The conference rooms don't have reliable video equipment and it makes remote meetings really painful."

Aldric: "Great question. Vanessa, do you have an update?"

Kline: "Yes — we've approved the Portland office AV upgrade. The equipment has been ordered and we expect installation the first week of February. New Poly cameras, microphones, and displays in all four conference rooms. We've also added a booking system so you can reserve rooms from the Nextera app."

Q from floor (employee, engineering): "Is there any update on the remote work policy? Are we still doing three days in office?"

Kline: "The policy hasn't changed. It's three days in office — Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday — with Monday and Friday as optional remote days. We're seeing about 74% office occupancy on the in-office days, which is right where we want it. If you have an individual accommodation request, please talk to your manager or reach out to me directly."

Q from floor (employee, product): "Marcus mentioned the Kubernetes migration has a maintenance window on February 5. How long will the platform be down?"

Webb: "Good question. We're planning for a four-hour maintenance window, from 2 AM to 6 AM Pacific. Customer-facing APIs will be unavailable during that period. We'll notify affected customers at least two weeks in advance through the status page and direct email. The engineering team has rehearsed the migration three times in staging and we're confident in the timing. We also have a rollback plan that can restore service within 30 minutes if we hit any issues."

Q from floor (employee, finance): "Priya, can you talk about the capex budget for 2025? $12.6 million seems like a significant investment."

Vasquez: "Sure. The $12.6 million in capex is primarily driven by three things. First, the Kubernetes migration and infrastructure modernization — that's approximately $4.5 million in new infrastructure costs, though we expect it to generate a 60% cost reduction in ongoing cloud spend. Second, office buildout and equipment for the 63 new hires — that's about $3.8 million including hardware, furniture, and buildout costs for expanding the Portland and San Francisco offices. Third, the remainder is allocated to software tooling, security infrastructure, and R&D equipment. The return on the infrastructure investment alone should pay for itself within 18 months."

[DAVID ALDRIC — CLOSING REMARKS]

Great questions, everyone. Thank you.

I'll close with this: 2025 is going to be a big year for Nextera. We have the product, the team, the customers, and the capital to make it happen. I've been doing this for a while, and I can tell you — the alignment between product-market fit, team capability, and financial strength that we have right now is something special. Not every company gets this moment. We have it, and we are not going to waste it.

Let's go build something great.

Next all-hands is scheduled for February 6. Have a great rest of your week.

Subject: Q1 Pipeline Review — Thursday Prep

Team,

Quick update before our pipeline review this afternoon at 2 PM.

I've pulled the latest numbers from Salesforce and here's where we stand:

Q1 PIPELINE SUMMARY:
  Total pipeline: $42.6M (across all stages)
  Weighted pipeline: $14.8M
  Coverage ratio: 3.2x against $36.8M annual quota (need ~$9.2M Q1)
  Active opportunities: 87 (34 enterprise, 53 mid-market)
  New opportunities created in January: 14
  Average deal age: 34 days

Enterprise pipeline: $18.4M across 34 active opportunities. Weighted: $7.8M. We need $9.2M to hit Q1 quota.

Pipeline looks healthy but we need to close the gap on mid-market. Paulo, let's double down on the Kinaxis displacement playbook.

I want to review three things at 2 PM:
1. Top 10 deals by weighted value — who owns them, what's the status, what's the next step
2. Mid-market at-risk deals — Paulo has flagged two that need immediate attention
3. Competitive landscape — Kinaxis is getting more aggressive, and I want to make sure we have a plan

Diana, I need updated competitive battle cards from product marketing. Can you get those by end of next week? We need current pricing intelligence on both Kinaxis and Palantir for our mid-market and enterprise motions.

Everyone please come prepared to discuss your top 3 opportunities and what specific actions you need to close them. I want to hear about blockers — if you need resources, executive involvement, or product support, this is the time to raise your hand.

Kevin

Kevin,

Enterprise update: of the 34 active opportunities, 8 are in late-stage negotiation (Stage 4+). Here's the breakdown:

Stage 4 (Negotiation): 8 opps, $6.2M total ACV
  - GlobalFreight (LOB expansion): $420K — legal review in progress, expected to close by Jan 24
  - Pacific Rim Shipping: $380K — POC completed, waiting on procurement
  - Atlas Distribution: $310K — champion has verbal approval, working on paperwork
  - Tidewater Logistics: $280K — final presentation scheduled Jan 15
  - UrbanShip Inc: $240K — in redline on master service agreement
  - 3 additional deals between $120K-$190K each

Stage 3 (Evaluation): 12 opps, $5.8M total ACV
  - 4 of these are actively in POC, expected to move to Stage 4 within 3 weeks
  - 8 in technical evaluation phase with varying timelines

Stage 2 (Discovery): 9 opps, $4.1M total ACV
Stage 1 (Qualification): 5 opps, $2.3M total ACV

I'll have the competitive battle cards updated by January 17. I'm working with product marketing to get the latest Kinaxis pricing data — we've heard they're offering 18-month contracts with first-year discounts of up to 30% in the mid-market. That's aggressive, but it also signals they're trying to buy market share rather than win on product.

One thing I want to flag: I'm seeing a new player — SupplyVision AI — starting to show up in enterprise deals. They've appeared in 3 of our last 10 competitive evaluations. Small team, maybe 40 people, Series A funded, but their product is getting attention from CIOs who are looking for AI-native supply chain tools. I'll include them in the updated battle cards.

On the hiring front: the 4 new sales reps starting Monday will go through a 2-week structured onboarding program. I've updated the onboarding deck to include the latest competitive scenarios and product positioning. They'll also do ride-alongs with senior AEs in week 2. I want them carrying quota by February 10 at the latest.

Kevin,

Mid-market update: 53 active opportunities totaling $24.2M. Weighted pipeline is $7.0M.

The two at-risk deals I flagged:

1. NordicTrans (Sweden): $85K ACV — they received a competing proposal from Kinaxis at approximately 25% below our price. The champion is pushing for us but procurement is price-sensitive. I've requested a meeting with their VP Supply Chain to discuss value prop. Meeting is tentatively set for January 14. My plan is to walk them through the ROI model we built for FreightCo, which showed 3.2x return in 14 months. Similar operations profile, so the numbers should translate.

2. Cascade Logistics (Portland): $68K ACV — went dark after the holiday break. Last contact was December 18. I've sent two follow-up emails and a LinkedIn message. Planning to call the champion directly today. If I can't reach them by Friday, I'll recommend we move this to nurture and focus energy elsewhere. No point chasing ghosts when we have a pipeline to work.

On the Kinaxis displacement playbook: I've updated the deck based on our Q4 wins. Key differentiators we're emphasizing: (1) real-time data processing — their solution is batch-based with 4-hour refresh cycles, (2) our recommendation engine — they don't have anything comparable, (3) API-first architecture vs. their legacy integration model. The playbook now includes three customer case studies with specific ROI metrics that our AEs can reference in competitive situations.

I'll walk through the updated playbook at 2 PM.

Additional mid-market metrics for context:
  Average deal size in mid-market: $62K ACV
  Average sales cycle: 78 days
  Win rate overall: 31%
  Win rate at POC stage: 41%
  Pipeline-to-close conversion rate (Q4): 23% (below our historical 26% average, attributed to holiday slowdown)
  Deals pushed from Q4 to Q1: 7 (total value $490K)

Good updates, both of you.

Paulo — on NordicTrans, let me know if you need executive sponsorship for that call. I can join if it would help. We can't lose deals on price alone. If their procurement team is driving a cost-based decision, we need to get above procurement and talk to someone who cares about outcomes. The ROI model approach is exactly right.

Diana — the SupplyVision AI intel is interesting. Let's keep an eye on that. I want a full briefing at next week's leadership meeting. Include whatever you can find on their founding team, funding, product capabilities, and pricing. If they're showing up in 30% of our enterprise evals, we need to be prepared.

Quick reminder of key metrics for context:
  - Q1 sales quota: $36.8M new ARR (full year target)
  - Average deal size (enterprise): $185K ACV
  - Average deal size (mid-market): $62K ACV
  - Sales headcount: 48 (target: 58 by end of Q1)
  - Win rate overall: 31%
  - Average sales cycle: 78 days

We're bringing on 10 new reps this quarter. First cohort of 4 starts Monday. Diana, please make sure the onboarding deck is current and includes the updated competitive materials.

Also — I want everyone to review their Salesforce hygiene before the 2 PM meeting. Deal stages, next steps, close dates, and contact roles should all be current. I'm going to be pulling live reports during the review and I don't want any surprises.

See everyone at 2 PM. Come prepared to talk about your top 3 deals and what you need to close them.

Kevin

Kevin,

Onboarding deck is current as of last week. I'll add the SupplyVision AI overview slide before Monday. The new reps will also go through a 2-week structured onboarding program that includes product deep dives, competitive scenarios, and ride-alongs with senior AEs.

One more data point for the pipeline review: our Q4 pipeline-to-close conversion rate was 23%, which is slightly below our historical average of 26%. I attribute most of the gap to the holiday slowdown in December — deals that were in negotiation pushed to January. We should see some of those close early this quarter, which would give Q1 a head start.

On SupplyVision: I'll pull together a competitive brief by Monday. Here's what I know so far: founded in 2023, based in New York, raised $28M Series A from Andreessen Horowitz in September 2024. Their pitch is "AI-native supply chain optimization" — lots of buzzy language about foundation models for logistics. Product is early but polished in demos. Their CEO is former McKinsey. I've heard mixed reviews from prospects — impressive demo, but concerns about product maturity and lack of enterprise references. I'll dig deeper and have the full brief ready for the leadership meeting.

Please update your account health scores by end of day Friday. I'll be reviewing all yellow and red accounts in our Monday leadership meeting.

[08:35 AM] tomas.lindgren
@amanda.briggs Flagging Freight Corp as yellow. Their implementation is 3 weeks behind schedule. Their IT team has been slow on API integration. I've been in contact with their project manager, Jennifer Wu, twice this week but she's been unresponsive on the data mapping deliverables.

Freight Corp implementation is 3 weeks behind schedule. Their IT team has been slow on API integration. @tomas.lindgren please escalate to their VP of Engineering.

Here's the timeline status:
- Original go-live date: December 15, 2024
- Revised go-live date: January 6, 2025 (missed)
- Current projected go-live: February 7, 2025
- Blockers: Data mapping (60% complete), API integration (40% complete), UAT not started
- Account value: $320K ACV
- Risk level: Medium — no churn signal, but implementation delays affect NPS and expansion potential

[08:37 AM] amanda.briggs
@tomas.lindgren Thanks for the flag. Can you draft an escalation email to their VP of Engineering? I'll review and co-sign. We need to get their team unblocked. This is a $320K account and we can't let the implementation drag. Let's aim to get the email out by end of day today.

[08:38 AM] tomas.lindgren
@amanda.briggs On it. I'll draft something and send it to you by noon. Their VP of Engineering is Mark Stevenson — I've met him once at the kickoff. He seemed engaged but I think the issue is that their IT team is stretched across three other vendor implementations simultaneously.

I've also documented the full status in our account tracker. The Freight Corp Confluence page has a week-by-week implementation log if anyone needs the details: [Freight Corp Implementation Tracker](https://wiki.nextera.io/cs/freight-corp-impl)

[08:40 AM] amanda.briggs
@tomas.lindgren That context is helpful. In the escalation email, frame it as "we want to make sure Freight Corp gets full value from the platform by their target go-live date" rather than "your team is behind." Let's be diplomatic. Also mention that we're assigning a dedicated implementation engineer to the account this week — I cleared that with Marcus's team yesterday.

[08:42 AM] sarah.dumont
Quick update on the LogiFlow expansion. Had a great call with their VP Operations yesterday. They're ready to roll out to 3 additional warehouses — Cleveland, Memphis, and Phoenix.

LogiFlow is ready to expand to 3 additional warehouses. That's roughly $240K in expansion ARR if we close by end of January.

Their contract allows for mid-term expansion at the same per-unit rate, so this should be straightforward. I've sent the expansion order form and am waiting on procurement sign-off. Their VP said he expects it back by January 17.

Details:
- Current contract: $180K ACV, 2 warehouses (Chicago, Atlanta)
- Expansion: 3 additional warehouses (Cleveland, Memphis, Phoenix)
- Expansion value: $240K incremental ACV
- Contract term: aligned to existing 3-year agreement (28 months remaining)
- Champion: VP Operations, Michael Torres
- Expected close: January 17-24

[08:45 AM] amanda.briggs
@sarah.dumont Great work! $240K in expansion is a big deal. That's one of the largest expansion deals we've done. Let me know if you need any help clearing procurement. If it helps, I can do a reference call with their VP from one of our other warehouse logistics customers.

[08:46 AM] sarah.dumont
@amanda.briggs That would be amazing. If you could set up a reference call with someone from MaritimeHub — they deployed across 8 warehouses and can speak to the rollout experience — that would close the deal faster. Michael Torres mentioned they want to hear from a company that's done a similar multi-site deployment at scale.

[08:48 AM] amanda.briggs
@sarah.dumont I'll reach out to our contact at MaritimeHub today. Their CSM is Jessica Wong — I'll loop her in. MaritimeHub's VP of Logistics, Karen Zhao, has done a reference call for us before and she was great. Let me check her availability for next week.

[08:50 AM] tomas.lindgren
FYI team — I'm also tracking the CloudPort account for potential churn risk. Their renewal is in March and the primary champion (their CTO, David Kim) left the company last month. The new CTO is still getting up to speed and hasn't returned my meeting requests. Moving this to yellow until I can establish contact with the new stakeholder.

CloudPort details:
- ACV: $185K
- Renewal date: March 15, 2025
- Champion status: lost (David Kim departed December 8)
- New CTO: Robert Chen, started December 15
- Contact attempts: 3 emails, 1 LinkedIn message (no response)
- Product usage: stable, no decline
- Risk assessment: Medium — usage is fine but relationship is broken

@tomas.lindgren Good flag. CloudPort is $185K ACV — we can't afford to lose that. Please escalate to Kevin's team as well so they can activate the renewal playbook. Set up an executive sponsor meeting if needed — David Aldric has met their CEO before. I'd also suggest sending a welcome package to the new CTO — flowers or something — with a note introducing yourself. Sometimes the personal touch matters more than another meeting request in their inbox.

Reminder: QBR templates have been updated for Q1. The new template includes a section on product adoption metrics and a customer satisfaction question. Please use the updated template for all QBRs starting this week.

QBR template updates are due January 13. Link: [Q1 QBR Template](https://docs.nextera.io/cs/qbr-template-q1-2025)

Changes from Q4 template:
1. Added product adoption metrics section (feature usage percentage, API call volume, active users)
2. Added NPS question directly in the QBR
3. New section for expansion opportunity identification
4. Updated ROI framework to include recommendation engine v3 features
5. Removed the legacy support ticket summary (moved to automated monthly report)

[08:57 AM] amanda.briggs
@jason.reeves Thanks Jason. Team — please make sure you're using the updated QBR template. The new adoption metrics section is important because it ties directly to our expansion playbook. If a customer is using less than 60% of their licensed features, we want to flag that as a growth opportunity, not just a risk. The data shows that customers who use 80%+ of features have a 3x greater expansion rate.

Also — has anyone heard back from the NexGen Fleet team? I sent them a check-in email last week about their Q1 roadmap discussion and haven't heard anything. They're green but I want to make sure they're engaged ahead of their May renewal.

[09:02 AM] jason.reeves
@sarah.dumont I spoke with their operations lead last Thursday. They're happy with the platform and mentioned they're evaluating an expansion to include their European fleet. Could be a $150K-$200K expansion opportunity. I'll set up a proper discovery call and loop you in. They're particularly interested in the route optimization features that are coming in the dashboard redesign.

[09:04 AM] amanda.briggs
Love hearing about these expansion opportunities. Remember, team — our net revenue retention of 119% is one of the metrics the board watches most closely. Every expansion deal we close strengthens that number. Keep pushing.

Quick summary of our expansion pipeline for Q1:
- LogiFlow: $240K (likely, Jan close)
- NexGen Fleet: $150-200K (early stage, need discovery)
- Three other accounts in various stages: combined $180K
- Total expansion pipeline: ~$620K-$670K

That's strong. Let's keep building it.

[09:08 AM] tomas.lindgren
@amanda.briggs One more thing — can we discuss the CSM-to-account ratio at the Monday meeting? We're currently at 1:12 and with the new accounts coming in from Kevin's team, we're going to be stretched thin. I know we have 2 CS hires budgeted for Q1, but timing matters. If those hires don't start until March, we'll have a rough February.

[09:10 AM] amanda.briggs
@tomas.lindgren Absolutely. I'll add it to the Monday agenda. The two CS hires are actually already in the pipeline — one has accepted and starts January 27, the other is in final interviews. So the timing should be manageable. But I hear your concern and we'll discuss it in detail on Monday.

Platform Migration Update: Kubernetes 1.29

To: All Engineering
From: Marcus Webb, VP Engineering
Date: January 9, 2025

Team,

I'm writing to give you a comprehensive update on our Kubernetes 1.29 migration project, which is a key initiative for Q1 2025.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Phase 1 is done. Staging is running clean on K8s 1.29. Lisa's team will begin production migration February 3. Plan for a 4-hour maintenance window on February 5.

PHASE 1 COMPLETION — STAGING ENVIRONMENT

Lisa Chen and the platform team completed the staging environment migration over the holiday break. The staging cluster is now fully running on Kubernetes 1.29 on our AWS EKS infrastructure. Key results from the staging migration:

  - All 47 microservices migrated successfully
  - Zero downtime during the migration process
  - All automated tests passing (integration, load, and smoke tests)
  - Datadog monitoring dashboards have been updated to reflect the new architecture
  - No rollback was required at any point during the migration

Load test results are particularly encouraging. Lisa's team has been running load tests at 2x peak traffic levels on the staging environment over the past week.

Load test results: p99 latency at 2x traffic is 340ms, well within our 500ms SLA.

Detailed load test metrics:
  - Concurrent connections tested: 15,000
  - Sustained throughput: 8,400 requests/second
  - p50 latency: 45ms
  - p95 latency: 190ms
  - p99 latency: 340ms
  - Error rate: 0.003%
  - Test duration: 4 hours continuous
  - CPU utilization at peak: 72%
  - Memory utilization at peak: 64%

The full load test report is available in Confluence: [K8s 1.29 Load Test Results](https://wiki.nextera.io/eng/k8s-129-loadtest)

CURRENT INFRASTRUCTURE

For context, here's what our current production infrastructure looks like:

  - 94 EC2 instances across 3 AWS regions (us-west-2, us-east-1, eu-west-1)
  - 47 microservices
  - Primary region: us-west-2 (Portland, OR) — hosts 52 instances
  - Secondary region: us-east-1 (N. Virginia) — hosts 28 instances
  - DR region: eu-west-1 (Ireland) — hosts 14 instances
  - Total monthly infrastructure cost: approximately $185K/month
  - Target: 60% cost reduction through containerization (to approximately $74K/month)

The cost savings from containerization are significant. At $185K/month, we're spending $2.22M annually on infrastructure. A 60% reduction would save approximately $1.33M per year. This is one of the highest-ROI projects in the engineering portfolio.

PRODUCTION MIGRATION PLAN

Production migration is scheduled for February 3-7, with the following timeline:

  February 3 (Monday): Begin migration of stateless API services
    - Services affected: 12 API gateway services, 8 authentication services
    - Expected duration: 8 hours
    - Zero-downtime deployment using blue-green strategy

  February 4 (Tuesday): Migrate worker and queue services
    - Services affected: 15 background workers, 4 queue processors
    - Expected duration: 6 hours
    - Queue draining will be coordinated with on-call team

  February 5 (Wednesday): Main migration window — stateful services, databases, caches
    - Maintenance window: 2:00 AM - 6:00 AM Pacific
    - Customer-facing APIs unavailable during this period
    - Database migration includes PostgreSQL failover and Redis cluster reconfiguration
    - This is the highest-risk portion of the migration

  February 6 (Thursday): Post-migration validation and monitoring
    - Full regression test suite execution
    - Performance baseline comparison
    - Customer-facing monitoring verification

  February 7 (Friday): Final verification and migration sign-off
    - Sign-off from: Marcus Webb, Lisa Chen, Frank Gutierrez (security)
    - Migration declared complete or rollback initiated

ROLLBACK PLAN

We have a comprehensive rollback plan documented in Confluence: ENG-2025-MIG-001. Key elements:

  - Pre-migration snapshots of all production databases
  - DNS failover to legacy infrastructure within 15 minutes
  - Automated rollback scripts tested in staging (3 full rehearsals completed)
  - Rollback decision authority: Marcus Webb (primary), Lisa Chen (backup)
  - Maximum acceptable rollback time: 30 minutes
  - Rollback decision criteria: (1) customer-facing error rate exceeds 1%, or (2) p99 latency exceeds 1000ms for more than 10 minutes, or (3) data integrity check fails

DR MIGRATION (PHASE 3)

The disaster recovery environment migration is planned for March, after production migration is validated. We'll share more details on the DR migration timeline in February. The DR environment in eu-west-1 currently hosts 14 instances and serves as our cross-region failover. The migration approach will mirror the production migration with a separate maintenance window.

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO

1. Review the K8s 1.29 Compatibility Checklist for your services: [Link](https://wiki.nextera.io/eng/k8s-compat-129)
2. Update your Helm charts if your service uses deprecated API versions (check the deprecation list in Confluence)
3. Verify your service's resource limits and requests are correctly configured — K8s 1.29 has tighter enforcement on resource quotas
4. Review the updated Datadog dashboards for your service: [Link](https://app.datadoghq.com/dashboard/nextera-k8s-129)
5. If your service is in the February 5 maintenance window (stateful services), coordinate with Lisa Chen's team by January 24
6. Update your runbooks to reflect the new Kubernetes commands and dashboard locations
7. Attend the migration readiness review on January 27 at 10 AM in the large conference room (or join via Zoom)

QUESTIONS?

Please direct questions to #platform-migration Slack channel or reach out to Lisa Chen directly. We'll also be holding office hours every Wednesday at 2 PM through the migration period.
