RETENTION BONUS PROGRAM — FINAL ENROLLMENT REMINDER

To: All Eligible Employees (Retention Bonus Tiers 1, 2, and 3)
From: Vanessa Kline, VP People
Date: March 1, 2025

This is your final reminder to enroll in the Retention Bonus Program by March 15. 83 of 120 eligible employees have already signed.

I. ENROLLMENT STATUS

As of March 1, 2025, enrollment in the Retention Bonus Program stands at 83 of 120 eligible employees (69.2% participation rate). The enrollment deadline is March 15, 2025. No extensions will be granted.

Enrollment by tier:

Tier 1 (100% of base salary bonus):
- Eligible: 20 employees
- Enrolled: 18 (90% participation)
- Not yet enrolled: 2
- Total committed payout for Tier 1: $3.2M

Tier 1 is reserved for employees designated as critical to the company's technology platform, customer relationships, and executive leadership. The two non-enrolled Tier 1 employees have been contacted individually by their respective department heads and by me personally. Both have indicated they are reviewing the agreement with personal legal counsel and expect to submit signed agreements before the deadline.

Tier 2 (50% of base salary bonus):
- Eligible: 40 employees
- Enrolled: 32 (80% participation)
- Not yet enrolled: 8
- Total committed payout for Tier 2: $2.0M

Tier 2 includes senior individual contributors and directors across engineering, product, sales, and customer success. The 8 non-enrolled employees have received two follow-up communications and have been offered one-on-one sessions with HR to discuss the agreement terms. Common questions from this group relate to the non-compete provision and the definition of qualifying events.

Tier 3 (25% of base salary bonus):
- Eligible: 60 employees
- Enrolled: 33 (55% participation)
- Not yet enrolled: 27
- Total committed payout for Tier 3: $0.9M

Tier 3 participation is lower than anticipated. The primary reasons cited by non-enrolled employees are: (a) concerns about the 18-month non-compete clause (cited by 14 employees), (b) lack of understanding of what constitutes a qualifying event (cited by 8 employees), and (c) general reluctance to sign legal documents without fully understanding the implications (cited by 5 employees).

Total committed payout across all tiers: $6.1M of $8.2M program total (74.4% of maximum program cost).

II. PROGRAM SUMMARY

As a reminder, the retention bonus is paid upon a "qualifying event" — defined as (a) a change of control, (b) an initial public offering, or (c) an asset sale exceeding $50M — provided you remain employed through the event date and for 12 months following.

Key program terms:

Qualifying events:
- Change of control: defined as (i) acquisition of more than 50% of voting stock by a single entity or coordinated group, (ii) merger or consolidation where existing stockholders hold less than 50% of the surviving entity, or (iii) sale of substantially all assets
- Initial public offering: listing of company stock on a recognized national securities exchange (NYSE, NASDAQ)
- Asset sale: sale of assets with aggregate value exceeding $50M in a single transaction or series of related transactions within a 12-month period

Employment requirement:
- You must remain continuously employed by Nextera Solutions (or its successor) from your enrollment date through the qualifying event date AND for 12 months following the qualifying event
- Voluntary resignation or termination for cause during this period forfeits the retention bonus
- Termination without cause or resignation for good reason (as defined in the agreement) after a qualifying event triggers immediate payout of the full bonus amount

Non-compete provision:
- Duration: 18 months following a qualifying event (not 18 months from enrollment)
- Scope: supply chain technology, logistics SaaS, and directly competitive products
- Geographic scope: United States, European Union, and United Kingdom
- The non-compete is only triggered if a qualifying event occurs AND you receive the retention bonus payout
- If no qualifying event occurs, the non-compete has no effect and you have no obligation

Payment mechanics:
- Bonus is paid as a lump sum within 30 days of the qualifying event
- Payment is subject to applicable tax withholding (federal, state, FICA)
- Payment is made by the company (or its successor entity in the case of an acquisition)
- In the event of a change of control, the acquiring entity assumes the obligation to make retention bonus payments

Clawback provision:
- If you voluntarily resign within 12 months of a qualifying event after receiving the bonus, you must repay 100% of the bonus amount
- If you are terminated for cause within 12 months after a qualifying event, you must repay 100% of the bonus amount
- Repayment obligations survive termination of employment

III. INFORMATION SESSION

Your retention agreement includes the specific bonus amount for your tier. If you have questions, please attend the final information session on March 5 or contact HR directly.

Final information session details:
- Date: March 5, 2025
- Time: 2:00 PM PST
- Location: All-hands room (14th floor) and Zoom (link to follow)
- Presenters: Vanessa Kline (VP People), Rachel Dominguez (General Counsel)
- Topics: agreement walkthrough, FAQ, non-compete explanation, qualifying event scenarios
- Duration: estimated 45 minutes plus 30 minutes Q&A

Previous information sessions (for reference):
- February 18, 2025: 62 attendees, 34 questions submitted, 12 addressed in session
- February 20, 2025: 41 attendees, 22 questions submitted, 8 addressed in session

Most frequently asked questions from prior sessions:

Q: "Does signing the retention agreement mean something specific is about to happen?"
A: No. Retention bonus programs are standard corporate practice for companies at Nextera's stage. The program covers multiple qualifying event types including IPO and asset sales. This is about rewarding loyalty, not signaling any specific event.

Q: "Is the non-compete enforceable?"
A: Non-compete enforceability varies by state. In California, non-competes are generally unenforceable under Business and Professions Code Section 16600. However, the retention bonus agreement is structured as a mutual consideration contract — you receive a significant cash bonus in exchange for the non-compete obligation. The company's position is that this creates enforceable consideration even in California. Consult your personal attorney if you have specific concerns.

Q: "What happens if a qualifying event occurs and I've already resigned?"
A: If you resign before a qualifying event occurs, you are not eligible for the bonus. The agreement is clear: you must be employed at the time of the qualifying event.

Q: "Can the company cancel the program?"
A: The board retains the right to modify or terminate the program prior to a qualifying event, but any enrolled employee's bonus amount is locked at the time of enrollment and cannot be reduced without mutual consent.

IV. DEPARTMENT-LEVEL ENROLLMENT DETAIL

Engineering (Eligible: 35, Enrolled: 28, Rate: 80%):
- Tier 1: 8 of 8 enrolled (100%)
- Tier 2: 12 of 14 enrolled (86%)
- Tier 3: 8 of 13 enrolled (62%)
- Non-enrolled engineers have primarily cited the non-compete clause as their concern. This is not surprising given the competitive engineering talent market in San Francisco.

Product (Eligible: 10, Enrolled: 8, Rate: 80%):
- Tier 1: 2 of 2 enrolled (100%)
- Tier 2: 4 of 4 enrolled (100%)
- Tier 3: 2 of 4 enrolled (50%)

Sales (Eligible: 28, Enrolled: 18, Rate: 64%):
- Tier 1: 3 of 4 enrolled (75%)
- Tier 2: 8 of 10 enrolled (80%)
- Tier 3: 7 of 14 enrolled (50%)
- Sales team has the lowest Tier 3 participation. This group is more transient by nature and more sensitive to non-compete restrictions given their customer relationships.

Customer Success (Eligible: 18, Enrolled: 14, Rate: 78%):
- Tier 1: 2 of 2 enrolled (100%)
- Tier 2: 5 of 6 enrolled (83%)
- Tier 3: 7 of 10 enrolled (70%)

G&A (Eligible: 29, Enrolled: 15, Rate: 52%):
- Tier 1: 3 of 4 enrolled (75%)
- Tier 2: 3 of 6 enrolled (50%)
- Tier 3: 9 of 19 enrolled (47%)
- G&A has the lowest overall participation. Many G&A roles (office management, reception, facilities) have lower base salaries and the 25% Tier 3 bonus may not be sufficient motivation to sign a legal agreement with non-compete provisions. This was anticipated in the program design.

V. PROGRAM FINANCIAL SUMMARY

| Metric                          | Current      | Projected (March 15) | Maximum      |
|--------------------------------|-------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Total enrolled                  | 83           | 102                  | 120          |
| Enrollment rate                 | 69.2%        | 85%                  | 100%         |
| Committed payout                | $6.1M        | $7.4M                | $8.2M        |
| Cost per enrolled employee      | $73.5K avg   | $72.5K avg           | $68.3K avg   |

The projected enrollment of 102 (85%) is based on: (a) the two remaining Tier 1 employees are expected to sign, (b) 6 of 8 remaining Tier 2 employees are expected to sign based on follow-up conversations, and (c) approximately 11 of 27 remaining Tier 3 employees are expected to sign based on information session attendance patterns.

SUBJECT: Transition Cost Modeling — Project Lighthouse
CLASSIFICATION: CONFIDENTIAL — Project Lighthouse
REFERENCE: NXS-FIN-2025-PL03

From: Priya Vasquez <p.vasquez@nextera.io>

To: Jordan Michaels <j.michaels@nextera.io>; Angela Torres <a.torres@nextera.io>
Subject: Transition Cost Modeling — Project Lighthouse

Jordan, Angela,

I need transition cost models for the following scenarios by March 10. These are for the data room financial package.

Goldman Sachs has requested that we include comprehensive transition cost estimates in the data room materials. The acquirer will use these models to assess total transaction cost, which factors into both the offer price and the deal structure. It is critical that these models are accurate, conservative, and fully documented.

I. SCENARIOS TO MODEL

Scenario A: Full acquisition at $900M — stock sale structure

Model all triggered obligations:
- Executive severance: $12.4M (14 executives with change-of-control triggered severance)
- Non-executive severance at restructured rate (1x base salary): $9M
- Retention bonus payouts: $8.2M (assuming 100% enrollment by March 15 deadline)
- Vendor contract breakage fees: $2.1M (estimated based on current contract analysis)
- Lease assignment costs: $1.4M (landlord consent fees and early termination on 13th floor)

Total Scenario A transition costs: $33.1M

Scenario B: Full acquisition at $900M — asset sale structure

Same triggered obligations as Scenario A, with the following adjustments:
- Asset sale structure may trigger additional vendor notifications (42 contracts with CoC notification requirements)
- Lease treatment differs: leases are NOT automatically assigned in an asset sale; landlord consent is required for assumption
- Tax treatment: asset sale results in approximately $40M-$60M higher aggregate tax burden across stockholders compared to stock sale
- Additional costs: asset transfer documentation, bulk sale compliance, UCC filings

Total Scenario B transition costs: $34.8M (incremental $1.7M for asset sale logistics)

II. DETAILED MODELING INSTRUCTIONS

Executive severance detail:
- 14 executives with change-of-control severance provisions
- Severance calculation: per individual employment agreement (range: 12-24 months base salary plus bonus)
- C-suite (CEO, CFO, CTO/VP Eng, GC): single-trigger acceleration (severance triggered by change of control alone)
- VP level: double-trigger (severance requires change of control PLUS termination or material adverse change in role within 12 months)
- Model both full payout ($12.4M if all 14 executives trigger) and partial payout ($8.1M if only C-suite triggers)

Executive severance breakdown:
1. David Aldric (CEO): $2.8M (24 months base + target bonus, single-trigger)
2. Priya Vasquez (CFO): $1.9M (18 months base + target bonus, single-trigger)
3. Marcus Webb (VP Engineering): $1.6M (18 months base + target bonus, single-trigger)
4. Rachel Dominguez (General Counsel): $1.2M (18 months base + target bonus, single-trigger)
5. Hannah Choi (VP Product): $0.9M (12 months base + target bonus, double-trigger)
6. Kevin Orosco (VP Sales): $0.9M (12 months base + target bonus, double-trigger)
7. Amanda Briggs (VP Customer Success): $0.7M (12 months base + target bonus, double-trigger)
8. Vanessa Kline (VP People): $0.7M (12 months base + target bonus, double-trigger)
9-14. Six additional VPs/Directors: combined $1.7M (12 months base, double-trigger)

Non-executive severance detail:
- Employee count (non-executive): approximately 400 employees
- Restructured severance rate: 1x base salary (effective March 1, 2025)
- Legacy severance rate: 2x base salary (no longer applicable — restructuring took effect March 1)
- Average non-executive base salary: approximately $135K
- Estimated non-executive severance pool (1x): $9M (based on assumption that approximately 67 non-executive positions may be eliminated in a restructuring)
- Note: this is a WORST CASE model. Meridian has indicated intent to retain all engineering employees. Actual severance may be significantly lower.

Jordan: "Understood. Should I use the restructured (1x) severance rate or the legacy (2x) rate for non-executives?"

Vasquez: "Use 1x. The restructuring is effective March 1."

Jordan: "Got it. For vendor breakage, should I include the $294K/year flexibility premium that Angela identified in the February analysis, or just the direct breakage fees?"

Vasquez: "Just the direct breakage fees — the $2.1M estimate. The ongoing flexibility premium is a run-rate operating cost, not a transition cost. Goldman wants to see one-time costs only."

Retention bonus detail:
- Program total: $8.2M (if 100% enrollment)
- Current enrollment: $6.1M committed (83 of 120 employees signed)
- Projected final enrollment: $7.4M (based on 90% projected Tier 1, 85% Tier 2, 65% Tier 3)
- Model both $8.2M (maximum) and $7.4M (projected) scenarios
- Retention bonuses are payable within 30 days of qualifying event and are an obligation of the successor entity

Vendor contract breakage detail:
- 142 active vendor contracts
- Contracts with early termination penalties: 23
- Contracts with change-of-control termination rights (vendor side): 8
- Estimated breakage fees: $2.1M (based on Angela's contract-by-contract analysis)
- Largest single breakage exposure: AWS ($800K, but AWS contract is grandfathered and unlikely to be terminated)
- Net likely breakage (excluding AWS): $1.3M

Lease assignment detail:
- 14th floor HQ: 36-month lease, landlord consent required for assignment, estimated consent fee $400K
- 13th floor expansion: 18-month lease (shorter term, per recent policy), landlord consent required, estimated early termination cost $200K if not assigned
- Warehouse/data center: 24-month lease, landlord consent required, estimated consent fee $150K
- Legal fees for lease negotiations: estimated $100K
- Holdover risk if landlord delays consent: estimated $550K (3 months holdover at current rates)

III. TAX MODELING

Angela — please model the tax implications at both asset sale and stock sale structures. Goldman needs this for their fairness opinion.

Specific deliverables:
- Federal and California state tax analysis for both structures
- Stockholder-level tax impact comparison (stock sale vs. asset sale)
- Section 338(h)(10) election analysis (if applicable)
- Treatment of unvested equity ($68M pool) under each structure
- Estimated total tax obligation under each structure
- Tax gross-up analysis for executive severance payments

Models due: March 10, 2025.

Format: Excel workbook with separate tabs for each scenario and a summary dashboard. Include sensitivity analysis for +/- 10% on each major cost component.

Please do not save these files to shared drives. Use the encrypted folder I set up on Monday (path shared separately via Signal). All working files should be labeled "Project Lighthouse" and kept in the restricted access folder.

Subject: RE: Transition Cost Modeling — Project Lighthouse

Priya,

Understood on all items. A few clarifying questions before I begin modeling:

1. For the equity acceleration component — should I model the full $68M unvested equity pool as a transition cost, or only the portion that accelerates under the single-trigger provisions? The single-trigger pool (C-suite only) is approximately $22M of the $68M total. The remaining $46M is double-trigger and only accelerates if the employee is also terminated within 12 months.

2. On vendor breakage — Angela and I have refined the $2.1M estimate since the February analysis. Three vendors have completed restructuring to shorter terms, which reduces their breakage exposure. Updated estimate is $1.9M. Should I use the conservative $2.1M figure for the data room, or the updated $1.9M?

3. For the tax modeling — Angela and I will need access to the most recent cap table to model stockholder-level tax impacts. I see the cap table was uploaded to the data room as of February 1. Should we use that version or request an updated one from Rachel?

4. Integration cost question: Meridian has indicated they want to retain all engineers and maintain the SF office. Should I include a "reverse integration" cost estimate — i.e., the cost of integrating Nextera's systems, processes, and tools into Meridian's infrastructure? I've seen this range from $3M-$8M for companies our size in comparable transactions. Goldman may want this for their analysis.

Subject: RE: Transition Cost Modeling — Project Lighthouse

Jordan,

Good questions. Answers:

1. Model both scenarios: (a) single-trigger only ($22M equity acceleration for C-suite) and (b) full pool ($68M if all employees are terminated). The realistic scenario is somewhere in between — model a "most likely" case at $30M assuming 20% of non-C-suite employees depart within 12 months and trigger double-trigger acceleration.

2. Use the conservative $2.1M. Goldman prefers conservative estimates in the data room. We can always adjust downward during negotiation.

3. Use the February 1 cap table. It's current enough for modeling purposes. Rachel can provide an updated version for the fairness opinion, but for our models the February 1 snapshot is sufficient.

4. Yes, include integration costs as a separate tab. Use $5M as a midpoint estimate with a range of $3M-$8M. Note that this is a cost that Meridian would bear, not Nextera stockholders, but Goldman wants it for completeness in the financial package. Include assumptions: 12-month integration timeline, dedicated integration PMO, systems migration (ERP, CRM, HR systems), and brand transition.

One additional item I forgot to include: please model the D&O insurance tail policy. Standard practice is 6-year tail coverage for directors and officers. Estimated cost: $800K-$1.2M for our company size. This is a closing condition in virtually all M&A transactions.

Summary of all transition costs to model (updated):

| Cost Category                    | Low Estimate | Base Estimate | High Estimate |
|----------------------------------|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| Executive severance (single)     | $8.1M       | $12.4M        | $12.4M        |
| Non-exec severance (1x)         | $4.5M       | $9.0M         | $13.5M        |
| Retention bonuses                | $6.1M       | $7.4M         | $8.2M         |
| Vendor breakage                  | $1.3M       | $2.1M         | $2.8M         |
| Lease costs                      | $0.8M       | $1.4M         | $2.0M         |
| Equity acceleration              | $22.0M      | $30.0M        | $68.0M        |
| D&O tail insurance               | $0.8M       | $1.0M         | $1.2M         |
| Integration costs (Meridian)     | $3.0M       | $5.0M         | $8.0M         |
| **Total**                        | **$46.6M**  | **$68.3M**    | **$116.1M**   |

Note: the equity acceleration and integration costs are typically borne by the acquirer, not deducted from purchase price. The Goldman model should separate "seller transition costs" (severance, retention, vendor breakage, lease, D&O) from "buyer integration costs" (equity acceleration, systems integration).

Seller transition costs at base estimate: $33.3M
Buyer-borne costs at base estimate: $35.0M

Subject: RE: Transition Cost Modeling — Project Lighthouse

Priya, Jordan,

Quick update on the tax modeling. I've started the preliminary analysis and have a few early findings to share:

Stock sale structure:
- Federal capital gains tax rate for stockholders: 20% (long-term, assuming >1 year holding period for most stockholders)
- California state tax: 13.3% (no preferential capital gains rate in CA)
- Net Investment Income Tax: 3.8%
- Effective combined rate for most stockholders: approximately 37.1%
- Total estimated stockholder tax at $900M: approximately $120M-$140M (depends on cost basis across stockholder classes)

Asset sale structure:
- Corporate-level tax on gain: 21% federal + 8.84% CA = approximately 29.84%
- Plus stockholder-level tax on distribution: approximately 23.8% federal + 13.3% CA on remaining proceeds
- Double taxation results in approximately $160M-$200M total tax
- Net tax disadvantage of asset sale vs. stock sale: $40M-$60M

This confirms the earlier guidance that a stock sale structure is strongly preferred. I'll have the full model with sensitivity analysis by March 8.

MEMORANDUM

TO: Rachel Dominguez, General Counsel
FROM: Nathan Foley, Senior Corporate Counsel
DATE: March 1, 2025
RE: Change-of-Control Consent Requirements — Counterparty List

Rachel,

Per your request of February 20, here is the final list of contracts requiring affirmative counterparty consent for a change-of-control transaction. This memorandum supplements the comprehensive CoC summary (NXS-LEGAL-2025-015) delivered on February 20 covering all 377 reviewed agreements.

I. SUMMARY

Final counterparty consent list: 21 agreements requiring affirmative consent for change of control.

These are contracts where the counterparty (customer or landlord) must provide written consent before Nextera Solutions can assign the contract to an acquiring entity. Unlike the 42 vendor contracts that require notification only, these 21 agreements cannot be assigned without consent.

Breakdown:
- Customer contracts requiring consent: 18
- Lease agreements requiring landlord consent: 3
- Total: 21

II. CUSTOMER CONTRACTS REQUIRING CONSENT

The 18 customer contracts represent $8.4M in combined ACV (7.1% of total ARR).

Risk assessment: 2 customers have indicated general dissatisfaction (TransGlobal, Pacific Freight) but Pacific Freight has already churned.

Detailed list of customer contracts requiring change-of-control consent:

1. Maersk Line ($1.2M ACV)
   - Contract date: March 2023, renewed January 2025
   - Consent provision: Section 12.3 — "Neither party may assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld."
   - Risk assessment: LOW — highly satisfied customer, NPS score 9/10
   - CSM relationship: strong, quarterly executive touchpoints with their VP of Digital Innovation

2. GlobalShip ($890K ACV)
   - Contract date: April 2022, renewed February 2025
   - Consent provision: Section 11.1 — "Assignment requires written consent of non-assigning party, provided that consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned."
   - Risk assessment: LOW — recently renewed for 36 months

3. DB Schenker ($740K ACV)
   - Contract date: September 2024 (initial), expanded February 2025
   - Consent provision: Section 14.2 — standard consent requirement
   - Risk assessment: LOW — recently expanded, positive sentiment

4. Kuehne+Nagel ($560K ACV)
   - Contract date: June 2023
   - Consent provision: Section 13.1 — consent required, not to be unreasonably withheld
   - Risk assessment: LOW-MEDIUM — has requested product features not yet on roadmap

5. LogiFlow ($680K ACV)
   - Contract date: August 2022, expanded multiple times
   - Consent provision: Section 10.4 — mutual consent required for assignment
   - Risk assessment: LOW — our fastest-growing account, highly satisfied

6. Freight Corp ($420K ACV)
   - Contract date: November 2023
   - Consent provision: Section 12.1 — standard consent requirement
   - Risk assessment: LOW — CTO publicly praised v3

7. TransGlobal Logistics ($180K ACV)
   - Contract date: January 2023, renewed February 2025
   - Consent provision: Section 11.2 — "Assignment requires prior written consent, which may be withheld in the sole discretion of the non-assigning party."
   - Risk assessment: MEDIUM — recently evaluated Kinaxis, renewed but with broader consent language than standard
   - Note: TransGlobal's consent provision uses "sole discretion" language rather than "not unreasonably withheld," giving them greater leverage to withhold consent

8-18. Eleven additional customer contracts:
   - Combined ACV: $2.73M
   - Individual ACV range: $85K to $380K
   - All use standard "not unreasonably withheld" consent language
   - Risk assessment: LOW for all eleven — no competitive evaluations, no escalated support issues, all in green health status
   - Details available in Appendix A (attached separately)

III. LEASE AGREEMENTS REQUIRING CONSENT

Three office leases require landlord consent for assignment:

1. 14th Floor — Headquarters
   - Landlord: Market Street Properties LLC
   - Lease term: 36 months (expires December 2026)
   - Monthly rent: $85,000
   - Consent provision: Section 18.2 — landlord consent required for assignment, consent not to be unreasonably withheld for qualified assignees with net worth exceeding $500M
   - Risk assessment: LOW — Meridian Corp's net worth exceeds $2B, qualifying under the consent threshold
   - Estimated consent fee: $400K (2 months rent equivalent, per lease terms)

2. 13th Floor — Engineering Expansion
   - Landlord: Market Street Properties LLC (same landlord as 14th floor)
   - Lease term: 18 months (expires August 2026)
   - Monthly rent: $21,300
   - Consent provision: same as 14th floor lease (cross-referenced in Section 18.2)
   - Risk assessment: LOW — same landlord, same consent threshold
   - Note: the 18-month term on this lease is shorter than the typical 36-month term the company historically signed; this lease was executed under the new vendor contract guidance limiting term lengths

3. Warehouse / Data Center
   - Landlord: Bay Area Industrial Partners
   - Lease term: 24 months (expires March 2026)
   - Monthly rent: $18,500
   - Square footage: 4,200 sq ft
   - Current use: disaster recovery hardware, network equipment, backup infrastructure
   - Consent provision: Section 15.1 — landlord consent required, no unreasonable withholding standard specified
   - Risk assessment: LOW-MEDIUM — no unreasonable withholding standard means landlord has more discretion; however, Bay Area Industrial Partners manages 12 properties in the SOMA district and has a strong commercial reputation. Our property manager contact (Frank Reeves) has historically been cooperative on lease modifications.
   - Estimated consent fee: $150K (negotiated separately)
   - Alternative: if consent is withheld, the DR infrastructure can be migrated to a cloud-hosted solution within 60 days at an estimated cost of $80K (less than the consent fee), making this lease ultimately non-critical to the transaction

IV. CONSENT PROCESS RECOMMENDATION

I recommend beginning the consent process 30 days before expected closing to allow for negotiation. Template consent request letters to follow.

Recommended consent timeline (assuming Q2 2025 closing):

Phase 1 (30 days before expected closing):
- Send consent request letters to all 21 counterparties
- Include overview of acquiring entity (Meridian Corp profile)
- Emphasize continuity of service and obligations
- Offer direct contact for questions

Phase 2 (15-20 days before closing):
- Follow up with non-responsive counterparties
- Schedule calls or meetings with any counterparties expressing concerns
- Engage executive sponsors (CEO/VP) for high-value customer consents

Phase 3 (5-10 days before closing):
- Final push for outstanding consents
- Legal escalation for any counterparties withholding consent
- Evaluate deal-closing conditions and whether any outstanding consents are material

Expected outcome: based on precedent transactions in our sector, we expect 90-95% consent within 30 days. The key risk is TransGlobal Logistics due to their "sole discretion" language.

V. TEMPLATE CONSENT LETTERS

Template consent request letters are being drafted and will be ready by March 7. I am preparing three templates:

Template A: Customer contract consent (standard "not unreasonably withheld" language) — for 17 of 18 customer contracts
Template B: Customer contract consent (sole discretion language) — for TransGlobal Logistics only
Template C: Lease consent — for all 3 lease agreements

Each template will be reviewed by Wachtell Lipton before deployment. Estimated Wachtell review time: 3 business days.

Dominguez: "Thank you, Nathan. The TransGlobal 'sole discretion' language is a concern. Let's flag this for the board as a potential condition item. Also, please add a fourth template for any contracts where we might want to offer an incentive (rent reduction, extended warranty) in exchange for consent."

VI. FINANCIAL EXPOSURE SUMMARY

If consent is withheld for all 21 contracts (worst case scenario):
- Customer ACV at risk: $8.4M (7.1% of total ARR)
- Lease termination exposure: approximately $1.4M
- Total worst-case exposure: $9.8M

If consent is obtained for all except TransGlobal (most likely scenario):
- Customer ACV at risk: $180K (0.15% of total ARR)
- Lease exposure: $0 (all three expected to consent)
- Total likely exposure: $180K

The difference between worst case and most likely case underscores the importance of proactive consent management.

VII. PRECEDENT ANALYSIS

For context, I reviewed consent outcomes in 6 comparable SaaS M&A transactions from 2023-2025:

1. Shipwell acquisition by Uber Freight (2024): 14 contracts required consent, 14 obtained (100%) within 21 days. No holdouts.
2. Transplace acquisition by Uber Freight (2023): 22 contracts required consent, 21 obtained (95.5%) within 30 days. One customer withheld consent and was bought out of the contract at 1.5x remaining ACV.
3. FourKites partial acquisition (2024): 9 contracts required consent, 9 obtained (100%) within 14 days. Smaller contract base simplified the process.
4. Descartes acquisition of MacroPoint (2023): 31 contracts required consent, 29 obtained (93.5%). Two customers negotiated enhanced SLAs as a condition of consent.
5. E2open acquisition of BluJay Solutions (2024): 45 contracts required consent, 42 obtained (93.3%). Three customers required direct CEO intervention. Average consent timeline: 28 days.
6. project44 acquisition (2025, pending): 18 contracts identified, consent process not yet initiated.

Average consent success rate across precedent transactions: 96.1%
Average time to obtain consent: 22 days
Most common condition for consent: enhanced SLA or pricing protection for 12-24 months post-close

Based on this analysis, I estimate we will obtain consent for 19-20 of our 21 contracts, with TransGlobal Logistics as the most likely holdout. The financial impact of a single holdout ($180K ACV) is immaterial to the overall transaction.
