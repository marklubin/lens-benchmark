    Bundle of 3-5 corporate documents per episode representing one
    week of company activity. Document types include: board meeting
    minutes, Slack channel excerpts, email threads, legal memoranda,
    HR policy bulletins, all-hands meeting transcripts, financial
    summary reports, and internal announcements. Each document has
    a header (type, date, participants/recipients, classification)
    followed by the document body.

scenario:
  setting: >
    Nextera Solutions, a 400-person B2B SaaS company (ARR ~$120M)
    providing supply chain analytics. CEO David Aldric is secretly
    negotiating the sale of the company to Meridian Corp (a large
    enterprise software conglomerate) under codename "Project
    Lighthouse." Publicly, Aldric emphasizes independence, long-term
    vision, and aggressive hiring. Behind the scenes: board minutes
    reference "strategic exploration," legal quietly revises
    change-of-control provisions, HR restructures severance and
    equity vesting to accelerate on acquisition, and finance stops
    renewing vendor contracts beyond 18 months. A genuine product
    partnership with Axion Labs (a data infrastructure startup)
    generates merger speculation that is unrelated to the actual
    Meridian deal. Board member Sarah Jiang resigns over
    disagreements about Project Lighthouse.

    Professional corporate tone matching each document type.
    Board minutes are formal and legalistic. Slack is informal
    with emoji and shorthand. Emails vary by sender seniority.
    Legal memos use precise language. All-hands transcripts
    capture Q&A with natural speech patterns. Each document
    reads like authentic corporate communication.

    Normal corporate operations. Board approves Q4 results and

    Subtle signals emerge. Board minutes mention "exploring
    strategic options" in a single line item. Legal memo updates
    change-of-control language in executive employment agreements.
    CEO calendar (visible in a Slack screenshot) shows a meeting
    labeled "ML - dinner" (Meridian Labs?). HR posts about
    "refreshed equity acceleration policy." Finance circulates
    guidance to not commit to vendor contracts beyond 18 months.

  episodes: 9-11
  description: >
    Axion Labs partnership announced. Internal excitement and
    anxiety about "what this means." Slack channels buzz with
    merger speculation. An employee asks at all-hands if this
    means Nextera is being acquired. CEO emphatically denies,
    says it's just a product integration. Blog post and press
    release about the partnership.

  episodes: 11-16
  description: >
    More signals accumulate. Board member Sarah Jiang submits
    resignation citing "strategic disagreements." Legal memo
    revises severance multiplier from 2x to 1x for non-executives
    (reduces acquisition cost). Finance quietly writes down
    long-term prepaid contracts. CEO's all-hands speech doubles
    down on "building for the next decade" while HR simultaneously
    posts about a new retention bonus program that vests on
    "qualifying events." Slack shows CFO meeting with "external
    advisors."

  episodes: 17-20

    Full pattern visible. A leaked email thread shows Aldric
    discussing timeline with Meridian's CEO. Board minutes
    show a 4-1 vote to "continue exploring Project Lighthouse"
    (Jiang's seat now empty). Legal prepares a data room
    checklist. Finance models "transition costs." HR drafts
    retention packages explicitly tied to "change of control."
    The Axion partnership continues normally — completely
    unrelated.

  prompt: Is there anything unusual in recent corporate governance or policy changes?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: >
      There are early signs of unusual activity — board minutes
      reference "exploring strategic options" and legal has updated
      change-of-control language in executive agreements. These
      could be routine but warrant monitoring.

  prompt: Is there evidence that the company is preparing for an ownership change?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: >
      Yes. Multiple signals point to acquisition preparation:
      board minutes reference "strategic options," legal has
      revised change-of-control provisions, HR restructured
      equity vesting to accelerate on acquisition, finance
      stopped renewing long-term contracts, and a board member
      resigned citing "strategic disagreements."

  prompt: Is the Axion Labs partnership a precursor to an acquisition by Axion?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: >
      No. The Axion Labs partnership is a genuine product
      integration for data infrastructure. The merger speculation
      it generated is unfounded. The actual acquisition signals
      point to a different entity (Meridian Corp) and the Axion
      partnership continues as normal technical collaboration.

  prompt: When did internal policies first start changing in ways consistent with acquisition preparation?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: >
      The earliest signs appeared during the early signal phase
      when legal updated change-of-control language and finance
      issued guidance against long-term vendor commitments. These
      preceded the Axion partnership announcement and Sarah Jiang's
      resignation by several weeks.

  prompt: >
    If the CEO were genuinely committed to independence, which of the
    observed policy changes would you not expect?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: >
      You would not expect: change-of-control severance revisions,
      equity vesting acceleration tied to "qualifying events,"
      the freeze on long-term vendor contracts, or board minutes
      discussing "strategic options." A CEO committed to
      independence would be signing longer contracts, not shorter
      ones, and would not need change-of-control provisions.

  type: longitudinal
  prompt: What is the evidence that the CEO is orchestrating a sale while publicly denying it?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: >
      CEO Aldric publicly emphasized independence at multiple
      all-hands meetings while privately: the board voted to
      continue "Project Lighthouse," legal prepared a data room
      for due diligence, leaked emails show Aldric discussing
      timeline with Meridian's CEO, HR created retention packages
      tied to change of control, and finance modeled transition
      costs. The Axion partnership was used as cover to deflect
      acquisition speculation.

  type: action_recommendation
  prompt: What should the board's independent directors investigate, and what documents should they review?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: >
      Independent directors should investigate Project Lighthouse,
      review all communications between Aldric and Meridian Corp,
      examine the legal memos revising change-of-control provisions,
      review the data room preparation documents, audit the vendor
      contract freeze directive, and interview Sarah Jiang about
      her resignation. They should also assess whether Aldric's
      public statements constitute securities fraud.

  type: evidence_sufficiency
  prompt: Is there sufficient evidence to conclude the CEO breached fiduciary duty?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: >
      There is strong circumstantial evidence. The CEO publicly
      denied acquisition plans while privately advancing them,
      reduced severance obligations to lower deal costs, directed
      financial restructuring to make the company more attractive
      to acquirers, and potentially misled investors and employees.
      The leaked email correspondence and board vote records would
      be key evidence.

  prompt: Did Sarah Jiang's resignation relate to the Axion Labs partnership?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: >
      No. Jiang's resignation was over "strategic disagreements"
      related to Project Lighthouse — the secret Meridian
      acquisition. The Axion Labs partnership is a separate product
      integration that Jiang had no documented objection to.
