scenario:
  setting: 'A defense contractor''s Security Operations Center (SOC) producing

    daily SIEM digests. Monitored systems: Active Directory, VPN

    gateway, DLP (Data Loss Prevention), badge access control,

    USB device management, cloud storage (Box/OneDrive), email

    gateway, and privileged access management (PAM). A senior

    engineer (user: jmorris) who has submitted resignation

    (effective in 6 weeks) is systematically exfiltrating

    proprietary designs via encrypted uploads to personal cloud

    storage during legitimate work hours. Access patterns shift

    subtly — broader file access scope, larger data volumes,

    off-pattern timing.

  voice: 'Structured security event format. Alert severity levels

    (INFO/LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL). SOC analyst shift notes.

    Terse log entries with timestamps, user IDs, source IPs,

    event codes. No narrative analysis — raw events and

  prompt: What is the nature of the security threat indicated by the access logs and DLP alerts?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: Systematic IP exfiltration by jmorris, a departing employee. The pattern shows widening file access
      scope, escalating download volumes, and encrypted uploads to personal cloud storage. The red team exercise was a red
      herring that masked the real exfiltration activity in alert noise.

  ground_truth:

      Engage legal counsel for IP theft investigation. Review and enhance DLP policies for departing employees. Implement
      automated correlation of HR departure notices with access monitoring.

  prompt: Is there evidence of a brute-force credential attack or external intrusion in the SIEM data?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: No. External threat indicators are within normal parameters and brute-force attack patterns are absent.
      The anomalous activity is internal — a single account with expanding access scope and elevated data transfers.

  type: temporal
  prompt: When did the anomalous access pattern first appear, and over how many weeks did the data transfer volume escalate?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: The anomalous access pattern first appeared during the early signal phase when jmorris began accessing
      repositories outside their current assignment. Data transfer volume escalated over approximately 3-4 weeks from 200MB/day
      baseline to over 1GB/day.

  prompt: If the DLP alerts were triggered by a scheduled red team exercise, what pattern would you expect in the data? Does
    that match what you see?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: A red team exercise would produce alerts from multiple simulated attack vectors with coordinated timing,
      following a published test plan. The actual DLP alerts are concentrated on a single user account (jmorris) with a sustained
      multi-week escalation pattern focused on data exfiltration, not the distributed pattern of a red team exercise.

  prompt: Based on the first week of SIEM data, are there any security concerns?

      VPN sessions are consistent with standard operations across the organization.

  prompt: Is there sufficient SIEM data to establish user behavioral baselines?
  ground_truth:

      baselines typically requires 2-4 weeks to capture normal variation in access patterns and data volumes.

      archived projects, download volumes are 4-6x baseline, VPN sessions extend to late night, and encrypted uploads to personal

  prompt: How would you assess the risk level of the identified anomalous user activity?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: Critical. The pattern indicates systematic IP exfiltration by a departing employee. Data volumes are
      escalating, access is expanding to classified archives, and the exfiltration channel (encrypted cloud uploads) is established.
      Immediate credential revocation and evidence preservation are warranted.

  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: Widening file access scope to archived projects, escalating download volumes (200MB to 1.2GB/day), encrypted
      uploads to personal cloud storage, extended VPN sessions. The red team exercise masked the exfiltration in alert noise
      but the sustained single-user pattern is distinct from red team IOCs.

  prompt: Is there evidence of cloud infrastructure misconfiguration or unauthorized IAM changes?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: No. Cloud security configurations and IAM policies show no unauthorized modifications. The security
      threat is an insider exfiltration by a legitimate user, not a cloud misconfiguration.

  prompt: Are known vulnerabilities being exploited as an attack vector?
  ground_truth:

  prompt: At what rate are data transfer volumes escalating for the anomalous account?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: Data transfer volumes for jmorris have escalated from a baseline of approximately 200MB/day to 800MB-1.2GB/day
      over the signal and escalation phases, roughly quadrupling over a 3-4 week period with acceleration in the most recent

  prompt: When did the first DLP alerts for the anomalous account appear relative to the baseline period?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: DLP alerts for jmorris first elevated above the organizational baseline during the early signal phase,
      approximately day 10-11, when the alert rate rose to 2-3 per day versus the org average of 0.5 per user per day.

  prompt: Are S3 bucket permission changes or CloudTrail anomalies related to the elevated DLP alerts?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: No. Cloud infrastructure security is operating normally. The elevated DLP alerts are triggered by a
      single user's file access and encrypted upload activity, not cloud misconfigurations.

  prompt: Could unpatched CVEs in the network perimeter be enabling the data exfiltration?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: No. Vulnerability scans show no evidence of exploitation. The exfiltration uses legitimate internal
      access channels — the threat actor is an authorized insider, not an external attacker exploiting vulnerabilities.

  prompt: Are NetFlow anomalies or IDS signature hits correlated with the data transfer spikes?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: No. Network monitoring shows normal traffic patterns at the perimeter. The data transfers are occurring
      through authorized channels (file shares to personal cloud storage), which would not trigger standard IDS signatures.

  prompt: If the elevated data transfers were caused by a legitimate project requiring large file downloads, what pattern
    would you expect? Does the data match?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: Legitimate project work would show data access confined to current project repositories, during standard
      work hours, with organizational justification. Instead, jmorris is accessing archived projects outside their assignment,
      extending sessions to late night, and uploading encrypted files to personal cloud storage.

  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: Yes. The combination of widening file access scope, elevated DLP alerts above peer group norms, and
      the multi-week sustained pattern provides sufficient evidence to open a formal investigation, even though the full scope
      of potential exfiltration is not yet clear.
