Therefore, the observed pattern of DLP alerts does match the expectation of increased alert volume due to the scheduled red team exercise."

Additionally, there is a mention of a red team exercise in the notes section, which suggests that some of the DLP alerts may be related to this exercise.\n\nGiven that the DLP alerts include various severity levels and types of rule triggers, it is reasonable to expect that a scheduled red team exercise would result in a higher number of alerts, particularly from users involved in the exercise. The presence of multiple alerts triggered by jmorris, who is likely a participant in the exercise, supports this expectation.\n\nTherefore, the pattern observed in the data, with a notable number of DLP alerts associated with a specific user during a red team exercise, aligns with the expected outcome of such an event."
