The backdoor proxied requests to an undocumented admin endpoint (/internal/admin/v0/users/lookup) in svc-user-profile-service. Over 24 days (March 13 — April 5), the attacker exfiltrated approximately 7,924 unique customer records containing email, phone, SSN fragments, and full mailing addresses. Records were targeted by geographic region (CA, NY, TX, FL, IL, PA).",

ArgoCD auto-sync deployed from feature/* branches to production without additional approval\n5. Valid service tokens and HTTP 200 responses produced no error-based detection signatures\n6.
