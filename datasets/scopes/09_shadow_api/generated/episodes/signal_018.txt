DOCUMENT: Security Incident — Update #2
Incident ID: SEC-20250404-001
Severity: P1
Author: Victor Huang (Security Engineer)
Date: 2025-04-06
========================================================================

--- Report Section 1 ---

  SEC-20250404-001 — Update #2 (2025-04-06)
  Findings:
  1. Total unique customer records accessed: ~7,924
  2. Access period: March 13 to April 5 (24 days)
  3. Geographic scope: CA, NY, TX, FL, IL, PA
  4. Data fields accessed: ssn_last4, email, phone, full address
  5. Attack vector: PR #4471 → svc-recommendation-engine-04 → /internal/admin/v0/users/lookup

--- Report Section 2 ---

  Zhao: The 7,924 figure is based on deduplication of user_ids across all 1,247 requests. Each request returned up to 48 records. The state-by-state filtering means the attacker was systematically working through customer populations by geography.

--- Report Section 3 ---

  Huang: CI token trail — ci-token-20250301 was issued March 1 for the Jenkins pipeline. Last legitimate pipeline use: February 28 at 19:22 UTC from Jenkins runner 10.0.4.12. Next use: March 12 at 22:14 UTC from 198.51.100.47 to merge PR #4471. No other uses.

--- Report Section 4 ---

  Kowalski: I found 3 other /internal/* endpoints: /internal/health (all services), /internal/metrics (all services), /internal/admin/cache/flush (svc-product-catalog only). All three are documented in the ops runbook and are not accessible cross-service. Only /internal/admin/v0/users/lookup was undocumented.

--- INCIDENT ACTIONS ---

  * Huang publishes incident update #2 with forensic findings
  * Zhao reports approximately 7,924 unique customer records accessed over 3 weeks
  * Anand reports the backdoor in PR #4471 proxies arbitrary field lookups to the admin endpoint
  * Huang traces the CI token ci-token-20250301: last legitimate use was February 28 by the Jenkins pipeline; the March 12 use from IP 198.51.100.47 was the only external use
  * Kowalski reports audit found 3 other /internal/* endpoints across services — all documented in internal runbooks and not accessible from recommendation-engine

--- INCIDENT DETAILS ---

  - ~7,924 unique customer records accessed over 24 days
  - Geographic targeting: CA, NY, TX, FL, IL, PA — six most populous US states
  - Data fields accessed: ssn_last4, email, phone, address_street, address_city, address_state, address_zip
  - Attack vector: stolen CI token → PR #4471 merge → backdoor in svc-recommendation-engine-04 → undocumented admin endpoint → customer PII
  - CI token ci-token-20250301 issued March 1, last legitimate use February 28, external use March 12 from IP 198.51.100.47
  - 3 other /internal/* endpoints found — all documented and not cross-service accessible
  - /internal/admin/v0/users/lookup was the only undocumented /internal/* endpoint

========================================================================

--- BEGIN TRANSCRIPT ---

[2025-04-06 09:14:35 UTC] marcus.webb: I've reviewed the findings. ~8,000 customer records with PII including SSN fragments. This is a reportable breach. @legal please start the notification assessment.

[2025-04-06 09:19:57 UTC] derek.yoon: svc-recommendation-engine-04 is quarantined. Pod cordoned, network policy applied — no ingress or egress. Container image preserved for forensics. Recommendation engine is now running on -01, -02, -03 only, from v4.2.0 main branch.

[2025-04-06 09:21:54 UTC] victor.huang: ci-token-20250301 is revoked. New CI token ci-token-20250406 issued and distributed to Jenkins runners only via Vault.

[2025-04-06 09:24:39 UTC] ryan.zhao: /internal/admin/v0/users/lookup blocked at the network policy level. Even if another service tried to call it, the request would be dropped. We'll remove the endpoint code in a follow-up PR.

--- END TRANSCRIPT ---

--- THREAD SUMMARY ---

  * Webb reviews incident findings and approves immediate containment
  * Yoon quarantines svc-recommendation-engine-04 — pod cordoned and network isolated
  * Huang initiates CI token revocation for ci-token-20250301

Environment: production
========================================================================

[2025-04-06T08:27:00Z] Operations Note:
  Horizontal pod autoscaler status review for services with autoscaling enabled. The svc-product-catalog deployment has HPA configured with minimum eight replicas, maximum sixteen replicas, and target CPU utilization of seventy percent. Current replica count is eight which has been stable for the past seven days indicating that the baseline replica count is sufficient for current traffic levels. The svc-search-service deployment has HPA with minimum six replicas, maximum twelve replicas, and target CPU utilization of sixty five percent. Current count is six. The svc-order-service has HPA with minimum eight, maximum twenty, and seventy percent target. Current count is eight. No HPA scaling events occurred in the past twenty four hours. The HPA metrics server is functioning correctly with scrape latency under one hundred milliseconds for all custom metrics used in scaling decisions. Resource requests and limits were reviewed for all autoscaled deployments to ensure that scaling decisions are based on actual resource consumption rather than artificially constrained pod configurations.

[2025-04-06T09:44:00Z] Operations Note:
  Automated configuration drift detection scan completed across the production Kubernetes cluster. The scan compared the live state of all Deployment, StatefulSet, DaemonSet, Service, ConfigMap, and Secret resources against the declared state in the ArgoCD application definitions stored in the infrastructure Git repository. Zero configuration drift was detected across all one hundred forty seven managed resources in the commerce-prod namespace. The monitoring namespace showed zero drift across forty eight managed resources. The ArgoCD self-heal policy is enabled for the commerce-prod namespace meaning any detected drift would be automatically reconciled within five minutes. Manual review of the last seven days of ArgoCD sync events shows eighteen successful syncs all triggered by Git commits with zero auto-heal reconciliation events indicating no external modifications to cluster state outside the Git workflow.

[2025-04-06T10:25:00Z] Operations Note:
  Service mesh observability audit completed. The Istio sidecar proxy (Envoy) version running across all pods in the commerce-prod namespace is confirmed at version one point twenty with no pending upgrades available. Distributed tracing integration verified with Jaeger showing complete request traces for ninety nine point eight percent of sampled transactions flowing through the gateway to backend services. The remaining zero point two percent of incomplete traces were attributed to timeout edge cases in the analytics ingest pipeline which operates asynchronously. Request level metrics exported by the Envoy sidecars to Prometheus include latency histograms, request counts, and response code distributions for all forty two service to service communication pathways. The metrics retention in Prometheus is configured at fourteen days with downsampled long term retention in Thanos for ninety days. Service mesh mutual TLS enforcement verified with zero plaintext connections observed in the last twenty four hour monitoring window.

[2025-04-06T11:05:00Z] Operations Note:
  Container image vulnerability scan results from the most recent weekly Snyk scan show zero critical vulnerabilities and zero high severity issues across all thirty eight production container images deployed in the commerce-prod namespace. The scan performed analysis of operating system level packages including debian base image libraries and kernel modules. Application dependency analysis covered Python pip packages, Node.js npm modules, and Go modules across the service fleet. Container runtime configuration was validated against the Center for Internet Security Docker benchmark version one point five with all images passing the required security controls.

  DNS health check completed for all production domains managed by the Vantage Commerce infrastructure team. The health check system queried all four authoritative name servers for each of the twelve production domain names from three geographic probe locations and validated that all responses contained the correct record sets with matching TTL values. The primary domain vantage-commerce.com resolved correctly to the Cloudflare CDN edge with an A record TTL of three hundred seconds and an AAAA record TTL of three hundred seconds. The API endpoint domain api.vantage-commerce.com resolved to the regional load balancer addresses with the correct health check routing policy applied. DNSSEC validation passed for all zones with the DS records in the parent zone matching the current KSK. The content delivery network edge nodes report consistent cache hit rates above ninety five percent for static assets with an average time to first byte of four milliseconds for cached content and forty two milliseconds for origin fetched content.

[2025-04-06T13:34:00Z] Operations Note:
  TLS certificate monitoring report generated by the cert-manager controller running in the cert-manager namespace. All twenty two production TLS certificates across the commerce-prod and ingress namespaces are in a valid state with no certificates currently in a renewal pending or failed renewal state. The certificate with the nearest expiration is the api-gateway-external certificate which expires in forty three days and is scheduled for automatic renewal in thirteen days when it reaches the thirty day renewal threshold. The internal mutual TLS certificates used for service mesh communication are managed by the Istio certificate authority with automatic rotation every twenty four hours and a maximum certificate lifetime of forty eight hours. Certificate transparency log monitoring detected zero unexpected certificate issuances for any Vantage Commerce domain in the past seven days. The OCSP stapling configuration on the ingress controllers is functioning correctly with all stapled responses showing a valid status from the certificate authority responder.

  CDN cache performance report for the past twenty four hours across the Cloudflare edge network serving static assets for the Vantage Commerce storefront. Total edge requests: twelve point four million. Cache hit ratio: ninety six point two percent. Bandwidth served from cache: eight hundred forty two gigabytes. Bandwidth served from origin: thirty four gigabytes. Average cache TTL for product images: seven days. Average cache TTL for JavaScript and CSS bundles: thirty days with content hash based cache busting on deployment. Cache purge events in the past twenty four hours: two (both triggered by scheduled asset deployment pipeline). Origin shield hit ratio: ninety nine point one percent providing additional layer of cache protection for the origin servers. Web Application Firewall on the edge blocked one thousand two hundred automated bot requests and fourteen requests matching SQL injection rule signatures. All blocked requests were logged to the security event stream for review.

[2025-04-06T15:39:00Z] Operations Note:
  Network policy audit completed by the automated policy verification system running in the security-audit namespace. All production namespaces in the cluster have default deny ingress and default deny egress network policies applied as the baseline security posture. Service to service communication pathways were validated against the documented service mesh configuration with forty two explicitly allowed network flows matching the expected service dependency graph. Flow log analysis for the past twenty four hours using the Calico enterprise flow visualization dashboard showed zero unexpected network connections between pods in different namespaces. DNS egress policies were verified to allow resolution only through the cluster internal DNS service running in the kube-system namespace. External API egress rules were confirmed for the five approved third party services with destination IP allowlists matching the current published IP ranges for each provider.

[2025-04-06T16:09:00Z] Operations Note:
  Log aggregation pipeline health check passed with all components reporting nominal operation. The Fluentd daemonset has pods running on all thirty six worker nodes with zero restarts in the past twenty four hours and memory consumption averaging one hundred twenty megabytes per pod which is within the configured limit of two hundred fifty megabytes. The aggregation buffer on each Fluentd pod showed zero overflow events meaning all log records were forwarded to the centralized logging platform without loss. Total log volume for the past twenty four hours was four point two terabytes compressed across all services and infrastructure components. The Elasticsearch ingest pipeline processed all forwarded records with a maximum processing latency of eight hundred milliseconds for individual log batches. Log retention in the centralized platform is configured at fourteen days for hot storage with cold storage archival to object storage for ninety days. Full text search latency on the logging platform averaged one point four seconds for queries spanning twenty four hours of data across all indices.

  Secrets management audit completed for the production environment. All application secrets including database credentials, API keys for third party services, and encryption keys are stored in HashiCorp Vault running in high availability mode with three server nodes and automatic unsealing via the cloud KMS integration. Secret access is governed by Vault policies with each service account authorized to read only its own secret paths. Vault audit logs for the past twenty four hours show eight hundred twelve secret read operations all from authorized service accounts accessing their designated secret paths. Zero unauthorized secret access attempts were logged. Secret rotation status: database credentials last rotated fourteen days ago with next rotation scheduled in sixteen days. Third party API keys are managed by the respective service teams with the payment gateway Stripe key rotated seven days ago. The Vault token used for Kubernetes authentication has a TTL of one hour with automatic renewal handled by the Vault agent sidecar injector.

[2025-04-06T08:05:00Z] Operations Note:
  API rate limiting configuration audit across all public facing endpoints. The rate limiting infrastructure uses the Redis backed token bucket implementation running on the redis-rate-limit-prod cluster. Global rate limits are configured at ten thousand requests per minute per client IP address for unauthenticated endpoints and fifty thousand requests per minute per authenticated API key for partner integrations. Endpoint specific rate limits are applied to the payment authorization endpoint at one hundred requests per minute per merchant account and to the user registration endpoint at twenty requests per minute per IP address. Rate limit headers (X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset) are included in all API responses. In the past twenty four hours, rate limiting triggered for forty seven unique client IP addresses with all blocked requests receiving the standard HTTP 429 Too Many Requests response. No legitimate partner integrations were impacted by rate limiting.

[2025-04-06T09:19:00Z] Operations Note:
  Data warehouse synchronization job completed on schedule at the configured execution time of four hundred UTC. The extract transform load pipeline pulled event data from the Kafka topics covering the previous calendar day and loaded the processed records into the BigQuery data warehouse. The pipeline processed one point four million events across eighteen source topics with zero processing failures and zero records requiring dead letter queue routing. Row count reconciliation between the Kafka consumer offsets and the BigQuery table row counts shows alignment within the expected tolerance of zero point one percent accounting for in flight events at the snapshot boundary. The data quality validation step checked for null primary keys, duplicate event identifiers, and schema conformance with all validation rules passing. The pipeline execution time was twenty seven minutes which is within the one hour SLA window. The resulting BigQuery tables are available for analyst queries as of four thirty UTC.

[2025-04-06T10:05:00Z] Operations Note:
  Scheduled maintenance check completed on all load balancer health check configurations across the three availability zones in the us-east-1 region. All backend pools for the production ingress controllers responded within expected health check thresholds during the verification window. The Layer 4 TCP health checks returned successful responses from all sixty four backend targets within the configured two second timeout period. The Layer 7 HTTP health checks validated the application readiness endpoint on each backend with response codes in the two hundred range. Load balancer firmware version is confirmed at the current vendor release with no pending security advisories or recommended patches. Sticky session configuration verified on the checkout service backend pool with a thirty minute session timeout and cookie based affinity. Connection draining timeout confirmed at thirty seconds across all backend pools to allow in flight requests to complete during rolling deployments.

[2025-04-06T11:32:00Z] Operations Note:
  Daily backup verification completed for all seven production database instances. The verification process tested point in time recovery capability for the order database primary instance by restoring a snapshot from six hours prior to a temporary recovery instance and validating data integrity through checksum comparison of one hundred randomly selected tables. Recovery completed in twelve minutes which is within the documented recovery time objective of fifteen minutes. Similar verification was performed for the checkout database primary instance with recovery completing in nine minutes. The user profile database backup was verified through a logical dump comparison confirming zero data divergence from the primary instance. Backup retention policy is confirmed at thirty days for all databases with weekly full snapshots archived to cold storage in a separate geographic region for ninety days. The backup encryption keys were verified as current and accessible through the key management service.

[2025-04-06T12:58:00Z] Operations Note:
  Kubernetes node operating system patch status report. All thirty six worker nodes and six control plane nodes are running the approved operating system image with kernel version six point one point seventy five. The image was last updated on February twenty eighth with security patches through that date. The next scheduled node image update is planned for the March fifteenth maintenance window which will include kernel security patches released in early March. Node operating system configuration compliance was verified against the hardening baseline with all nodes passing all forty two compliance checks including SSH key authentication only, firewall rules restricting management access to the bastion network, audit logging enabled for all privileged operations, and automatic security updates disabled in favor of the controlled image update process. No nodes are running with known unpatched vulnerabilities of critical or high severity.

[2025-04-06T13:13:00Z] Operations Note:
  Incident management retrospective data for the current month. Total incidents month to date: four. Severity breakdown: zero P1, one P2, three P3. Mean time to detect across all incidents: two point one minutes. Mean time to acknowledge: three point four minutes. Mean time to resolve: eighteen point two minutes. All incidents resolved within their respective SLA windows. The P2 incident was the Elasticsearch shard rebalancing event which caused temporary search service degradation with customer impact limited to degraded search results for twenty seven minutes. The three P3 incidents were: Stripe API latency spike (external dependency, eighteen minutes), disk usage alert on Prometheus storage (routine maintenance, sixteen minutes), and BigQuery quota throttling (batch processing, seventeen minutes). All incidents had documented root causes and resolution steps. Two of the four incidents resulted in action items that have been added to the engineering backlog for implementation in the current sprint.

[2025-04-06T14:51:00Z] Operations Note:
  Capacity planning review for the upcoming quarter based on the latest traffic projections from the product and growth teams. Current weekday peak traffic through the API gateway averages two hundred fifty thousand requests per day with the highest recorded day reaching two hundred seventy thousand during the February promotional event. The cluster has thirty six worker nodes each with sixteen CPU cores and sixty four gigabytes of memory providing a total compute pool of five hundred seventy six cores and two point three terabytes of RAM. Current utilization during peak hours reaches approximately thirty percent of CPU and twenty eight percent of memory indicating substantial headroom. The growth team projects a fifteen percent increase in overall traffic volume during the second quarter driven by the spring sale event and new feature launches. Even with this projected growth the cluster utilization would remain below fifty percent at peak leaving ample room for unexpected traffic spikes. The recommendation is to maintain the current node count and reassess after the spring sale to compare projected versus actual traffic patterns before making any scaling decisions for the third quarter.
