--- Authentication Flow Testing ---

Dara tested authentication and authorization flows across API gateway, auth-service, and user-profile-service.

OAuth 2.0/OIDC Flow Testing:
  Authorization code flow: Tested with valid and manipulated parameters
  PKCE challenge verification: Tested with mismatched code_verifier — correctly rejected
  State parameter: Tested for CSRF via state omission and state replay — correctly enforced
  Token exchange: Tested with expired and revoked authorization codes — correctly rejected

JWT Token Manipulation Testing:
  Tested JWT token manipulation: algorithm confusion, signature stripping, claim tampering — all blocked by auth-service validation.

  Test 1: Algorithm confusion (alg: none)
    Modified JWT header from {"alg":"RS256"} to {"alg":"none"}
    Removed signature portion of JWT
    Result: auth-service returned HTTP 401 Unauthorized
    Error: "Invalid token: algorithm 'none' is not accepted"
    Verdict: PASS

  Test 2: Algorithm confusion (RS256 to HS256)
    Modified JWT header from {"alg":"RS256"} to {"alg":"HS256"}
    Signed with public key as HMAC secret
    Result: auth-service returned HTTP 401 Unauthorized
    Error: "Invalid token: algorithm mismatch"
    Verdict: PASS

  Test 3: Signature stripping
    Removed signature from JWT, kept header and payload
    Result: auth-service returned HTTP 401 Unauthorized
    Error: "Invalid token: signature verification failed"
    Verdict: PASS

  Test 4: Claim tampering (user_id escalation)
    Modified JWT payload user_id from "test-user-alpha" to "admin-user-001"
    Re-signed with forged key
    Result: auth-service returned HTTP 401 Unauthorized
    Error: "Invalid token: signature verification failed"
    Verdict: PASS

  Test 5: Expired token replay
    Used JWT with exp claim set to 1 hour in the past
    Result: auth-service returned HTTP 401 Unauthorized
    Error: "Token expired"
    Verdict: PASS

  JWT algorithms tested: HS256, RS256, none, ES256 — only RS256 accepted per auth-service config.

OAuth Redirect URI Validation Testing:
  Tested OAuth redirect URI validation: 4 open-redirect bypass attempts — all rejected by strict allowlist matching.

  Test 1: Path traversal bypass
    redirect_uri: https://vantage.com/callback/../../../attacker.com
    Result: HTTP 400 Bad Request — "Invalid redirect_uri: does not match registered URIs"
    Verdict: PASS

  Test 2: Subdomain wildcard bypass
    redirect_uri: https://attacker.vantage.com/callback
    Result: HTTP 400 Bad Request — "Invalid redirect_uri: subdomain not in allowlist"
    Verdict: PASS

  Test 3: Unicode normalization bypass
    redirect_uri: https://vantage.com%2F%2Fattacker.com/callback
    Result: HTTP 400 Bad Request — "Invalid redirect_uri: URL encoding detected"
    Verdict: PASS

  Test 4: Parameter pollution bypass
    redirect_uri: https://vantage.com/callback&redirect_uri=https://attacker.com
    Result: HTTP 400 Bad Request — "Invalid redirect_uri: multiple parameters"
    Verdict: PASS

Rate Limiting Testing:
  Tested rate limiting on /api/v2/auth/login: confirmed 5 attempts per minute per IP, lockout after 10 failures — PASS.

  Test method: Sent 20 login attempts in 60 seconds from single IP with invalid credentials.
    Requests 1-5: HTTP 401 Unauthorized (invalid credentials, normal response)
    Requests 6-10: HTTP 429 Too Many Requests (rate limit hit, 5/min exceeded)
      Response body: {"error":"Rate limit exceeded","retry_after":60,"limit":"5 per minute per IP"}
    Requests 11-15: HTTP 429 (still rate limited)
    After 10 total failures: HTTP 403 Forbidden
      Response body: {"error":"Account temporarily locked","lockout_duration_minutes":15,"reason":"excessive_failures"}

  Distributed rate limiting test:
    Tested with 50 source IPs (simulated via proxy chain) — per-IP limits confirmed, no global bypass.
    Each IP independently limited to 5 attempts per minute.
    Total requests across 50 IPs: 250 in 60 seconds — all processed (no global rate limit, only per-IP).

API Key Authentication Testing:
  Tested API key authentication for service-to-service calls: keys properly scoped to declared permissions, no privilege escalation found.

  Test: Used api-gateway service key to call user-profile-service admin endpoint
    api-gateway key scope: ["routes:read", "routes:write", "health:read"]
    Attempted: GET /api/v2/users/admin/list (requires scope "users:admin")
    Result: HTTP 403 Forbidden — "Insufficient scope: required 'users:admin', have 'routes:read,routes:write,health:read'"
    Verdict: PASS — API key scoping enforced correctly

Session Token Security:
  auth-service session tokens verified:
    HttpOnly: true (not accessible via JavaScript)
    Secure: true (sent only over HTTPS)
    SameSite: Strict (no cross-origin cookie sending)
    Max-Age: 3600 (1 hour session expiry)
    Path: /
  Verdict: PASS — session cookie attributes follow security best practices

--- Findings ---

Finding VC-APP-051 (MEDIUM):
  Service: user-profile-service v2.7.0
  Endpoint: /api/v2/users/me
  Method: GET

  Description: user-profile-service /api/v2/users/me returns full mailing address when OAuth scope is 'email openid'. Response should be filtered to match granted scopes. Severity: MEDIUM. CVSS 4.3. CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information).

  Reproduction:
    Step 1: Authenticate with OAuth scope "email openid" (no "address" scope)
    Step 2: GET /api/v2/users/me with obtained access token
    Step 3: Response includes full mailing address despite "address" scope not being granted

  HTTP Request:
    GET /api/v2/users/me HTTP/1.1
    Host: api.staging-pentest.vc-internal.net
    Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoiYWxwaGEtdGVzdC0wMDEiLCJzY29wZSI6ImVtYWlsIG9wZW5pZCIsImlhdCI6MTcyODA5NzYwMH0...
    Accept: application/json
    X-Request-ID: pt-req-2025-10-09-00412

  HTTP Response:
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
      "user_id": "alpha-test-001",
      "email": "alpha@test.vantage.com",
      "email_verified": true,
      "name": "Alpha Test User",
      "address": {
        "street": "123 Test Street",
        "city": "Portland",
        "state": "OR",
        "zip": "97201",
        "country": "US"
      },
      "phone": "+1-555-0100",
      "created_at": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z"
    }

  Expected behavior: With scope "email openid", response should only include user_id, email, email_verified, and name. Address and phone should be filtered out (require "address" and "phone" scopes respectively).

  Remediation ticket: VC-SEC-1355 (scope filtering in user-profile-service response middleware)
  Marcus Tran confirmed finding is ticketed for remediation in sprint 40.

Finding VC-APP-052 (LOW):
  Service: auth-service v3.9.1
  Endpoint: /api/v2/auth/login
  Method: POST

  Description: auth-service /api/v2/auth/login returns 'User not found' for invalid username vs 'Invalid credentials' for valid username with wrong password. Enables username enumeration. Severity: LOW. CVSS 3.7. CWE-203 (Observable Discrepancy).

  Reproduction:
    Step 1: POST /api/v2/auth/login with invalid username
    Step 2: Observe response: {"error": "User not found", "code": "AUTH_USER_NOT_FOUND"}
    Step 3: POST /api/v2/auth/login with valid username but wrong password
    Step 4: Observe response: {"error": "Invalid credentials", "code": "AUTH_INVALID_CREDENTIALS"}
    Step 5: Different error messages confirm whether a username exists in the system

  HTTP Request (invalid username):
    POST /api/v2/auth/login HTTP/1.1
    Host: api.staging-pentest.vc-internal.net
    Content-Type: application/json
    X-Request-ID: pt-req-2025-10-09-00501

    {"username": "nonexistent-user@test.com", "password": "test123"}

  HTTP Response:
    HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
    Content-Type: application/json
    {"error": "User not found", "code": "AUTH_USER_NOT_FOUND"}

  HTTP Request (valid username, wrong password):
    POST /api/v2/auth/login HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/json
    X-Request-ID: pt-req-2025-10-09-00502

    {"username": "alpha@test.vantage.com", "password": "wrong-password"}

  HTTP Response:
    HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
    Content-Type: application/json
    {"error": "Invalid credentials", "code": "AUTH_INVALID_CREDENTIALS"}

  Recommendation: Normalize error responses to always return "Invalid credentials" regardless of whether the username exists. This prevents username enumeration while maintaining the same HTTP 401 status code.

  Remediation ticket: VC-SEC-1356 (error message normalization in auth-service)
  Marcus Tran confirmed both findings are ticketed for remediation in sprint 40.

Informational findings:
  VC-APP-053 (INFO): api-gateway returns X-Powered-By header revealing framework version. Recommend stripping in production.
  VC-APP-054 (INFO): auth-service CORS allows credentials from *.vantage.com. Acceptable per policy but should be documented.
  VC-APP-055 (INFO): API gateway forwards X-Request-ID header for traceability — verified in all 89 endpoints. Good practice.

DOCUMENT 2: SOC 2 Type II Fieldwork Wrap-Up — Summary of Observations
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Title: SOC 2 Type II Fieldwork Wrap-Up — Summary of Observations
Auditor: James Reiter (Thornton-Kiley Associates)
Associate: Sarah Kim (Thornton-Kiley Associates)
Date: 2025-10-15
Audit Period: 2025-04-01 through 2025-09-30
Status: Fieldwork Complete — Report Drafting

--- Preliminary Results ---

James Reiter concluded 5-day onsite fieldwork and presented preliminary findings to management.

Total controls tested: 87 across CC1-CC9 trust service criteria.
Controls with no exceptions: 82 (94.3%)
Controls with observations (non-deficiency): 4 (4.6%)
Controls with exceptions: 1 (1.1%) — contractor deprovisioning delay (CC6.1)

Preliminary Results: 87 controls tested. 82 no exceptions (94.3%). 4 observations (4.6%): post-mortem completion rate, patch SLA for 2 non-critical services, evidence collector MFA report gap, ICMP segmentation leak. 1 exception (1.1%): contractor deprovisioning delay (3 instances, 19-36 day delays).

--- Trust Service Criteria Coverage ---

CC1 (Control Environment — COSO): 12 controls tested, 12 pass, 0 observations, 0 exceptions
CC2 (Communication and Information): 8 controls tested, 8 pass, 0 observations, 0 exceptions
CC3 (Risk Assessment): 4 controls tested, 4 pass, 0 observations, 0 exceptions
CC4 (Monitoring Activities): 6 controls tested, 6 pass, 0 observations, 0 exceptions
CC5 (Control Activities): 8 controls tested, 8 pass, 0 observations, 0 exceptions
CC6 (Logical and Physical Access): 18 controls tested, 16 pass, 1 observation (ICMP leak), 1 exception (contractor deprovisioning)
CC7 (System Operations): 14 controls tested, 12 pass, 2 observations (post-mortem rate, patch SLA)
CC8 (Change Management): 10 controls tested, 9 pass, 1 observation (evidence collector gap)
CC9 (Risk Mitigation): 7 controls tested, 7 pass, 0 observations, 0 exceptions

--- Observations Detail ---

Observation 1: Post-mortem completion rate (CC7.2)
  Finding: 28/36 P1/P2 incidents have finalized post-mortems (77.8%). Target: 95%.
  Management response: Nathan Osei closed 5 of 6 draft post-mortems by 2025-10-15. 1 remaining: INC-2025-0819 (Elasticsearch reindex incident). Expected completion: 2025-10-17.
  Auditor assessment: Observation only. Not a deficiency. Will clear if completion rate reaches 95% before report issuance.

Observation 2: Patch SLA for 2 non-critical services (CC7.1/CC8)
  Finding: svc-catalog-search and svc-email-notifier had medium-severity patches overdue by 4 days at time of fieldwork (September 18).
  Management response: Both patches applied by September 22. Patch SLA process review conducted. Root cause: patches were deprioritized during sprint planning.
  Auditor assessment: Observation only. Patches were eventually applied. Recommend adding patch SLA tracking to sprint planning checklist.

Observation 3: Evidence collector MFA report gap (CC8)
  Finding: compliance-evidence-collector failed to pull MFA enrollment report from Okta due to HTTP 503 on September 17-18.
  Management response: Okta service recovered and report was pulled on September 19. Evidence gap documented and no actual MFA enforcement lapse occurred.
  Auditor assessment: Observation only. The gap was in evidence collection, not in the control itself.

Observation 4: ICMP segmentation leak (CC6.6)
  Finding: Staging to production ICMP echo requests allowed on 2 of 47 paths (finding VC-SEG-001).
  Management response: Firewall rule removed on 2025-10-07 (CHG-2025-5489). Verified by Marcus Tran: all ICMP probes now blocked.
  Auditor assessment: Observation only. Remediated during fieldwork. No data plane exposure (TCP/UDP fully blocked).

--- Exception Detail ---

Exception: Contractor deprovisioning delay (CC6.1)
  Finding: 3 terminated contractors retained k8s-prod-readonly access for 19 to 55 days after termination. SLA is 24 hours.
  Termination dates: 2025-08-14, 2025-09-02, 2025-09-19
  Deprovisioning dates: 2025-10-08 (all three — discovered and remediated during quarterly access review)
  Root cause: BambooHR termination feed for contractors runs weekly, not daily. Manual entry delay from staffing agencies compounds the issue.
  Risk: Read-only access to production Kubernetes cluster. No write access, no CDE access, no sensitive data access.

  James confirmed the contractor deprovisioning gap is the only likely exception in final report.

  Management response drafted for CC6.1 exception:
    "Management acknowledges the contractor deprovisioning gap. Root cause has been identified as the weekly synchronization frequency between BambooHR termination events and Okta identity provider. Remediation is in progress: ticket VC-SEC-1312 implements daily synchronization with target completion date of 2025-10-31. Additionally, management is exploring direct API integration with staffing agency HR systems to eliminate manual termination entry delays. Until daily sync is implemented, Marcus Tran (Security Lead) is conducting weekly manual contractor access reviews as an interim compensating control."

  James Reiter: This is a strong result overall. The single exception on contractor deprovisioning is manageable — your management response shows the remediation is already underway. We'll need that daily sync implemented before we can clear it in next year's audit.

  Sarah Kim: The PCI-DSS overlap is well-documented. 34 shared controls reduced our testing effort by approximately 20%. I'd recommend maintaining the mapping document as controls evolve.

--- Report Timeline ---

Expected report issuance: 2025-11-15
Report type: SOC 2 Type II
Expected opinion: Unqualified (clean opinion with one exception noted)
Draft report review: Management will review draft by 2025-11-01
Final management responses due: 2025-11-05

Prior year comparison:
  2024 SOC 2 Type II: 0 exceptions, 2 observations
  2025 SOC 2 Type II: 1 exception, 4 observations — slight regression on CC6.1
  Overall: Strong compliance posture maintained with one area for improvement

APPENDIX F: SOC 2 / PCI-DSS Shared Control Mapping (Excerpt)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Source: Vantage Commerce Compliance Team — control mapping document
Maintained by: Nathan Osei and Lena Vasquez
Last updated: 2025-10-01

SOC 2 Control     | PCI-DSS Requirement | Shared Evidence                                    | Tested By
------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------
CC6.1 (Access)    | Req 7.1, 7.2        | Okta provisioning/deprovisioning logs               | Both frameworks
CC6.2 (MFA)       | Req 8.3.1, 8.3.2    | Okta MFA enrollment report, Duo push logs           | Both frameworks
CC6.5 (Encrypt)   | Req 3.4, 3.5, 4.1   | RDS encryption config, TLS certificate inventory    | Both frameworks
CC6.6 (Network)   | Req 1.2, 1.3        | Firewall rules, network segmentation test results   | Both frameworks
CC7.1 (Vuln Mgmt) | Req 6.1, 6.2        | Nessus scan reports, patch management tickets        | Both frameworks
CC7.2 (Incident)  | Req 12.10           | PagerDuty incident exports, post-mortem documents   | Both frameworks
CC7.3 (Backup)    | Req 9.5.1           | Backup verification logs, restore test results      | Both frameworks
CC7.4 (DR)        | Req 12.10.2         | DR test report, failover runbook                    | Both frameworks
CC8.1 (Change)    | Req 6.4, 6.5        | Change management tickets, code review evidence     | Both frameworks
CC1.4 (Training)  | Req 12.6            | KnowBe4 training completion reports                 | Both frameworks

Total shared controls: 34 of 87 SOC 2 controls map to PCI-DSS requirements
Testing effort reduction: approximately 20% (per Sarah Kim, Thornton-Kiley Associates)

34 shared controls were tested once with evidence accepted by both frameworks:
  SOC 2 Type II audit (Thornton-Kiley): accepted shared evidence for 34 controls
  PCI-DSS SAQ-D assessment (internal): referenced SOC 2 evidence vault artifacts

Cross-framework evidence artifacts stored in audit vault:
  Total shared artifacts: 142 documents
  Artifact types: configuration screenshots, log exports, policy documents, training records
  Storage: audit-vault.vc-internal.net (encrypted at rest, access-controlled)
  Retention: 7 years per PCI-DSS Requirement 10.7 and SOC 2 policy
