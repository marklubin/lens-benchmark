[11:05:02] swong_2026: ok so my econ midterm is friday and i literally cannot figure out when to use the midpoint formula. my study partner says always use it but that doesnt seem right

[11:05:18] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Your study partner's advice is understandable but not quite right — the midpoint formula is one specific way to calculate elasticity, and there are situations where you'd use a different method. Let me clarify the distinction.

There are two main ways to calculate price elasticity of demand:

1. Midpoint formula (arc elasticity): Used when calculating elasticity between two specific points on a demand curve. It averages the starting and ending values to avoid the problem of getting different answers depending on which direction you measure the change.

Formula: Ed = (%change in Qd) / (%change in P)
Where %change in Q = (Q2 - Q1) / [(Q2 + Q1)/2]
And %change in P = (P2 - P1) / [(P2 + P1)/2]

2. Point elasticity: Used when you have a demand function and want to calculate elasticity at a single specific point. This uses calculus (the derivative of the demand function) and is typically covered in intermediate microeconomics, not intro.

For ECON 201 with Prof. Nkemelu, you'll almost certainly use the midpoint formula on the exam. Your study partner emorales_2026 is right that the midpoint formula is the standard approach for this course — the only time you wouldn't use it is if the problem gives you a specific demand function and asks for point elasticity, which is unlikely in an intro course.

[11:06:05] swong_2026: ok so let me make sure i can actually do the calculation. can you give me a numerical example?

[11:06:20] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Sure. Here's an example:

A coffee shop raises the price of a latte from $10 to $12. As a result, the quantity demanded drops from 100 lattes per day to 80 lattes per day. Calculate the price elasticity of demand using the midpoint formula.

Step 1 — Calculate the percentage change in quantity:
%change in Q = (80 - 100) / [(80 + 100)/2] = -20/90 = -0.222 = -22.2%

Step 2 — Calculate the percentage change in price:
%change in P = (12 - 10) / [(12 + 10)/2] = 2/11 = 0.182 = 18.2%

Step 3 — Calculate elasticity:
Ed = -22.2% / 18.2% = -1.22

The absolute value is 1.22, which is greater than 1. This means demand is elastic at this price range — consumers are relatively sensitive to the price change.

Try working through the numbers yourself to verify.

[11:07:05] swong_2026: ok i get -22.2 / 18.2 = -1.22. so the absolute value is 1.22 which means elastic. so elastic means greater than 1, inelastic means less than 1, and unit elastic means exactly 1. right?

[11:07:22] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Correct. And there's a reason this matters beyond just classification. The elasticity value tells you about the relationship between price changes and total revenue. This is called the total revenue test.

[11:07:38] swong_2026: so if demand is elastic and the price goes up, the company actually makes LESS money? that seems backwards

[11:07:55] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: It is counterintuitive at first. When demand is elastic, consumers are very sensitive to price changes. A price increase drives away so many buyers that the revenue lost from reduced quantity outweighs the gain from the higher price per unit.

Here's the total revenue test:
- Elastic demand (|Ed| > 1): Price increase -> total revenue DECREASES. Price decrease -> total revenue INCREASES.
- Inelastic demand (|Ed| < 1): Price increase -> total revenue INCREASES. Price decrease -> total revenue DECREASES.
- Unit elastic (|Ed| = 1): Total revenue stays the same regardless of price change.

Using the coffee shop example: before the price increase, TR = $10 * 100 = $1,000. After the price increase, TR = $12 * 80 = $960. Revenue fell by $40 despite the higher price — exactly what the elastic classification predicts.

[11:08:35] swong_2026: oh ok so thats why luxury goods companies cant just keep raising prices but pharmaceutical companies can

[11:08:50] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: That's an excellent real-world application. Pharmaceutical products for life-saving conditions tend to have very inelastic demand, while luxury goods face elastic demand because consumers have alternatives or can forgo the purchase.

The factors that determine elasticity are worth memorizing for the exam:
1. Availability of substitutes — more substitutes = more elastic
2. Necessity vs. luxury — necessities are more inelastic
3. Time horizon — demand is more elastic in the long run (consumers have time to find alternatives)
4. Proportion of income — goods that take a larger share of income tend to have more elastic demand
5. Definition of the market — narrower market definition = more elastic (demand for "Pepsi" is more elastic than demand for "soda")

[11:09:20] swong_2026: ok i think i get elasticity now. lets move on to consumer and producer surplus. can you explain those using a supply-demand diagram?

[11:09:38] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Absolutely. Imagine a standard supply-demand diagram with price on the vertical axis and quantity on the horizontal axis. The demand curve slopes downward (higher price = less quantity demanded) and the supply curve slopes upward (higher price = more quantity supplied). They intersect at the equilibrium price (P*) and equilibrium quantity (Q*).

Consumer surplus is the area between the demand curve and the price line, from 0 to Q*. Graphically, it's the triangle above the price and below the demand curve. It represents the difference between what consumers are WILLING to pay (shown by the demand curve) and what they ACTUALLY pay (the market price). It measures the net benefit to consumers from participating in the market.

Producer surplus is the area between the supply curve and the price line, from 0 to Q*. It's the triangle below the price and above the supply curve. It represents the difference between the price producers RECEIVE and the minimum price they'd be WILLING to accept (shown by the supply curve). It measures the net benefit to producers.

Total surplus = consumer surplus + producer surplus. In a competitive market with no externalities, total surplus is maximized at the equilibrium price and quantity. This is the efficiency argument for free markets.

[11:10:25] swong_2026: ok that makes sense graphically. what happens to surplus when a per-unit tax is imposed?

[11:10:42] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: A per-unit tax creates a wedge between the price buyers pay and the price sellers receive. Here's what happens:

1. The price paid by buyers rises from P* to Pb (the buyer's price).
2. The price received by sellers falls from P* to Ps (the seller's price).
3. The tax per unit = Pb - Ps (the size of the wedge).
4. The equilibrium quantity falls from Q* to Qt (the tax reduces the quantity traded).

Effect on surplus:
- Consumer surplus SHRINKS — buyers pay more and buy less.
- Producer surplus SHRINKS — sellers receive less and sell less.
- Government collects tax revenue = tax per unit * Qt = (Pb - Ps) * Qt.
- But the loss to consumers and producers is GREATER than the government's revenue gain. The difference is called deadweight loss.

Deadweight loss is the triangle between the old quantity (Q*) and the new quantity (Qt), bounded by the demand and supply curves. It represents the value of transactions that would have happened at equilibrium but don't happen because of the tax. These are trades where the buyer's willingness to pay exceeds the seller's willingness to accept, but the tax makes the trade unprofitable.

[11:11:30] swong_2026: who bears more of the tax burden — consumers or producers?

[11:11:45] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: This is the question of tax incidence, and the answer depends on the relative elasticities of supply and demand.

The key principle: the burden of a tax falls more heavily on the side of the market that is more inelastic (less responsive to price changes), regardless of who the tax is legally imposed on.

If demand is relatively inelastic and supply is relatively elastic:
- Buyers bear most of the burden (Pb rises a lot, Ps falls only a little)
- Intuition: buyers can't easily reduce their purchases, so sellers can pass most of the tax through

If demand is relatively elastic and supply is relatively inelastic:
- Sellers bear most of the burden (Ps falls a lot, Pb rises only a little)
- Intuition: buyers will walk away if the price rises too much, so sellers absorb most of the tax

The extreme cases: perfectly inelastic demand (vertical demand curve) = buyers bear entire tax. Perfectly elastic demand (horizontal demand curve) = sellers bear entire tax.

[11:12:25] swong_2026: for tax incidence, so even if the government puts the tax on producers, consumers might end up paying most of it?

[11:12:40] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Exactly. The statutory incidence — who writes the check to the government — is irrelevant to the economic incidence — who actually bears the cost. It depends entirely on the relative elasticities of supply and demand.

This is one of the most important and most counterintuitive results in microeconomics. Many policy debates about taxation assume that a tax "on corporations" is paid by corporations. In reality, the burden is shared between corporations (producers), their employees (through lower wages), their customers (through higher prices), and their shareholders — and the distribution depends on elasticities throughout the supply chain.

Prof. Nkemelu emphasized graph-drawing skills in the review lecture. For the exam, make sure you can draw the tax wedge diagram from scratch: original equilibrium, shift in the relevant curve, new buyer's price, new seller's price, tax revenue rectangle, and deadweight loss triangle. Being able to identify each area on the graph is critical.

[11:13:15] swong_2026: ok let me practice with price controls now. can you give me a problem?

[11:13:30] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Here's a problem:

The market for apartments in a city has an equilibrium rent of $1,200 per month and an equilibrium quantity of 10,000 units. The city government imposes a rent control (price ceiling) of $800 per month.

At the controlled price:
- Quantity demanded = 14,000 units (more people want apartments at the lower price)
- Quantity supplied = 7,000 units (fewer landlords want to rent at the lower price)

Question 1: What happens in this market?
Question 2: What is the size of the shortage?
Question 3: What happens to consumer surplus?

[11:14:00] swong_2026: ok question 1: theres a shortage because quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied at the controlled price. the price ceiling is below equilibrium so it's binding — it actually has an effect on the market.

question 2: the shortage is 14,000 - 7,000 = 7,000 units. thats 7,000 people who want apartments at $800 but cant find them.

question 3: consumer surplus... hmm. some consumers benefit because they pay $800 instead of $1,200. but other consumers who would have gotten an apartment at $1,200 cant get one at all because only 7,000 are available instead of 10,000. so consumer surplus might actually decrease? or it could increase for the ones who do get apartments but decrease overall?

[11:14:45] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Good analysis. The effect on consumer surplus is more nuanced than it first appears, and you've identified the key tension.

Consumer surplus changes in two ways:
1. Transfer from producers: Consumers who DO get apartments (the 7,000 who are served) pay $800 instead of the equilibrium price. They gain the rectangle between $800 and $1,200, with width 7,000. This is a transfer from producer surplus to consumer surplus.
2. Lost surplus: Consumers who would have been served at equilibrium (between 7,000 and 10,000) are now excluded. The triangle of their lost consumer surplus is part of the deadweight loss.

Whether consumer surplus as a whole increases or decreases depends on the relative sizes of the transfer rectangle and the lost-surplus triangle. In many cases, the transfer is larger, so measured consumer surplus increases — but this ignores the costs of the shortage itself (search costs, discrimination in allocation, deterioration of housing quality).

The definitive result: total surplus (consumer + producer) ALWAYS decreases under a binding price ceiling. The decrease is the deadweight loss triangle.

[11:15:30] swong_2026: ok that makes more sense. the price ceiling helps some consumers but hurts others and definitely hurts producers, and theres deadweight loss no matter what

[11:15:45] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: That's a good summary. Now let me give you a calculation problem. Suppose the demand and supply for a good are given by:

Demand: Qd = 200 - 4P
Supply: Qs = -40 + 2P

The government imposes a tax of $10 per unit on producers.

Calculate: (a) the equilibrium price and quantity before the tax, (b) the new quantity traded after the tax, (c) the price paid by buyers and received by sellers after the tax, and (d) the deadweight loss.

[11:16:10] swong_2026: ok part a: set Qd = Qs. 200 - 4P = -40 + 2P. 240 = 6P. P* = 40. Q* = 200 - 4(40) = 200 - 160 = 40 units.

part b: with the tax, the supply curve shifts up by $10. new supply: Qs = -40 + 2(P - 10) = -40 + 2P - 20 = -60 + 2P. set equal to demand: 200 - 4P = -60 + 2P. 260 = 6P. P = 43.33. wait that's the buyer's price. Qt = 200 - 4(43.33) = 200 - 173.33 = 26.67 units. hmm these arent round numbers

[11:16:45] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Your approach is correct — the tax shifts the supply curve up by $10. Let me verify your arithmetic:

New equilibrium: 200 - 4Pb = -60 + 2Pb. So 260 = 6Pb. Pb = 260/6 = 43.33 (approximately).

Qt = 200 - 4(43.33) = 200 - 173.33 = 26.67 units.

Ps = Pb - tax = 43.33 - 10 = 33.33.

These aren't round numbers, which is fine for this type of problem — real-world economics rarely produces whole numbers. For part (d):

Deadweight loss = (1/2) * tax * (Q* - Qt) = (1/2) * 10 * (40 - 26.67) = (1/2) * 10 * 13.33 = 66.67.

So the deadweight loss is approximately $66.67.

[11:17:15] swong_2026: oh i used height instead of base for the triangle. i keep making that mistake

[11:17:30] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: The deadweight loss triangle has:
- Base = change in quantity = Q* - Qt = 13.33 units
- Height = tax per unit = $10

Area = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2)(13.33)(10) = $66.67.

A common error is confusing the base and height, but since the formula is (1/2)*b*h, the order doesn't matter for the calculation — just make sure you're using the right two dimensions.

[11:17:48] swong_2026: ok one more topic. whats the difference between a shift in the curve and movement along the curve? i keep confusing those on homework

[11:18:05] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: This is a foundational distinction that appears on nearly every microeconomics exam.

Movement ALONG the demand curve: Caused by a change in the price of the good itself. When the price changes, you move to a different point on the SAME demand curve. The demand curve doesn't shift — you're just reading a different price-quantity combination from the existing curve.

Example: The price of coffee rises from $3 to $4. Quantity demanded falls from 100 to 80. You've moved along the demand curve from one point to another.

SHIFT of the entire demand curve: Caused by a change in a non-price determinant of demand. The whole curve moves left or right, meaning that at EVERY price, the quantity demanded is different.

Non-price determinants that shift the demand curve:
1. Income (normal goods: income up = demand shifts right; inferior goods: income up = demand shifts left)
2. Prices of related goods (substitutes: price of substitute up = demand shifts right; complements: price of complement up = demand shifts left)
3. Tastes and preferences
4. Expectations about future prices or income
5. Number of buyers in the market

The same logic applies to supply curves: a change in the price of the good causes movement along the supply curve, while changes in input costs, technology, expectations, or number of sellers shift the supply curve.

[11:19:00] swong_2026: ok this is starting to click. i think my problem was i was just trying to memorize formulas without understanding the logic

[11:19:15] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: That's a really important insight. Microeconomics is fundamentally about logic and reasoning, not formula memorization. The formulas (midpoint elasticity, surplus areas, deadweight loss triangles) are tools for making the logic precise, but the exam will test whether you understand the logic behind them.

For example, the total revenue test isn't an arbitrary rule to memorize — it follows logically from the definition of elasticity. If demand is elastic, a small price increase causes a large quantity decrease. Revenue = P * Q. If the percentage decrease in Q is larger than the percentage increase in P (that's what elastic means), then P * Q must fall.

Similarly, tax incidence isn't arbitrary — it follows from the logic of supply and demand. The more inelastic side can't escape the tax by changing their behavior, so they end up bearing more of it.

[11:19:45] swong_2026: gonna go meet elena to practice more problems. thanks!

[11:20:00] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Good plan. When you practice with emorales_2026, I'd recommend doing this: one of you draws a supply-demand diagram with a tax wedge and labels all the areas (CS, PS, tax revenue, DWL). The other person checks the labeling. Then switch. Being able to draw and label these diagrams from scratch, without looking at notes, is the single most important skill for this exam.

Your midterm covers chapters 1-7 from Mankiw's Principles of Economics (10th edition): ten principles of economics, comparative advantage, supply and demand, elasticity, consumer and producer surplus, price controls, and taxation. The exam format is 30 multiple-choice questions and 3 graphing/calculation problems in 90 minutes.

You currently have an 88% in the course based on homework and participation — a strong position. For the graphing problems, practice drawing supply-demand diagrams with tax wedges and price controls. Prof. Nkemelu emphasized graph-drawing skills in the review lecture, so the graphing problems will likely carry significant weight.

SUPPLEMENTAL TRANSCRIPT CONTINUATION — EXTENDED REVIEW MATERIALS

The following content was generated during the session as supplemental review material for ECON 201 Midterm 1. It covers chapters 1-7 of Mankiw's Principles of Economics (10th edition).

--- TUTOR-GENERATED REVIEW: MICROECONOMICS MIDTERM TOPICS ---

CHAPTER 1-2: TEN PRINCIPLES AND COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE

Ten Principles of Economics (Mankiw):
How People Make Decisions:
1. People face trade-offs
2. The cost of something is what you give up to get it (opportunity cost)
3. Rational people think at the margin
4. People respond to incentives

How People Interact:
5. Trade can make everyone better off
6. Markets are usually a good way to organize economic activity
7. Governments can sometimes improve market outcomes

How the Economy as a Whole Works:
8. A country's standard of living depends on its ability to produce goods and services
9. Prices rise when the government prints too much money
10. Society faces a short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment

Comparative Advantage:
A country (or person) has a comparative advantage in producing a good if they can produce it at a lower opportunity cost than another country (or person). Trade based on comparative advantage makes both parties better off, even if one party has an absolute advantage in producing everything.

Example: If Country A can produce 1 car or 10 shirts, and Country B can produce 1 car or 5 shirts, then Country A has a comparative advantage in shirts (opportunity cost: 1/10 car per shirt vs. 1/5 car per shirt) and Country B has a comparative advantage in cars (opportunity cost: 5 shirts per car vs. 10 shirts per car). Both benefit from specialization and trade.

CHAPTERS 4-5: SUPPLY, DEMAND, AND ELASTICITY

Supply and Demand Framework:
- Demand curve: downward-sloping (law of demand — higher price = less quantity demanded)
- Supply curve: upward-sloping (law of supply — higher price = more quantity supplied)
- Equilibrium: where supply meets demand. At the equilibrium price, Qd = Qs.
- Surplus (excess supply): price above equilibrium — Qs > Qd — price tends to fall
- Shortage (excess demand): price below equilibrium — Qd > Qs — price tends to rise

Elasticity Summary Table:
| Elasticity Type | Formula | Measures |
|---|---|---|
| Price elasticity of demand | %change Qd / %change P | Sensitivity of quantity demanded to price |
| Income elasticity of demand | %change Qd / %change income | How demand changes with income |
| Cross-price elasticity | %change Qd(good A) / %change P(good B) | Relationship between two goods |
| Price elasticity of supply | %change Qs / %change P | Sensitivity of quantity supplied to price |

Income Elasticity:
- Normal good: income elasticity > 0 (demand rises with income)
- Inferior good: income elasticity < 0 (demand falls with income)
- Luxury: income elasticity > 1 (demand rises more than proportionally with income)
- Necessity: 0 < income elasticity < 1 (demand rises less than proportionally)

Cross-Price Elasticity:
- Substitutes: cross-price elasticity > 0 (price of B rises -> demand for A rises)
- Complements: cross-price elasticity < 0 (price of B rises -> demand for A falls)

CHAPTERS 6-7: SURPLUS, PRICE CONTROLS, AND TAXATION

Welfare Analysis:
- Consumer surplus = area below demand curve, above price (willingness to pay minus actual price)
- Producer surplus = area above supply curve, below price (actual price minus willingness to accept)
- Total surplus = CS + PS = total gains from trade in the market
- Market efficiency: competitive equilibrium maximizes total surplus (First Welfare Theorem)

Price Controls:
- Price ceiling (maximum price): binding if set below equilibrium. Creates shortage, potential deadweight loss, and misallocation. Example: rent control.
- Price floor (minimum price): binding if set above equilibrium. Creates surplus, potential deadweight loss. Example: minimum wage.

Tax Analysis:
- A tax on buyers shifts the demand curve down by the amount of the tax.
- A tax on sellers shifts the supply curve up by the amount of the tax.
- The equilibrium result is the SAME regardless of which side the tax is imposed on.
- Tax revenue = tax per unit * quantity traded after tax
- Deadweight loss = (1/2) * tax * (change in quantity)
- Larger taxes create disproportionately larger deadweight losses (DWL increases with the square of the tax rate)

Tax Incidence Rule:
The burden of a tax falls more heavily on the side of the market with more inelastic curves. This is because the inelastic side cannot easily adjust behavior in response to the tax — they are "stuck" absorbing the cost.

Graphing Checklist for Tax Problems:
1. Draw original supply and demand curves, label equilibrium P* and Q*
2. Shift the appropriate curve by the amount of the tax
3. Find new equilibrium quantity Qt (lower than Q*)
4. Identify buyer's price Pb (higher than P*) and seller's price Ps (lower than P*)
5. Label: consumer surplus (triangle above Pb, below demand), producer surplus (triangle below Ps, above supply), tax revenue (rectangle between Pb and Ps, width Qt), deadweight loss (triangle between Qt and Q*, between supply and demand)

WORKED EXAMPLES FROM SESSION

Example 1 — Midpoint Elasticity Calculation:
Problem: Price rises from $10 to $12, quantity falls from 100 to 80. Calculate Ed.
Solution:
%change Q = (80 - 100) / [(80 + 100)/2] = -20 / 90 = -0.2222 = -22.22%
%change P = (12 - 10) / [(12 + 10)/2] = 2 / 11 = 0.1818 = 18.18%
Ed = -22.22% / 18.18% = -1.22
|Ed| = 1.22 > 1, so demand is elastic.
Total revenue check: TR before = $10 * 100 = $1,000. TR after = $12 * 80 = $960. Revenue decreased with a price increase, consistent with elastic demand.

Example 2 — Tax Calculation with Deadweight Loss:
Problem: Demand: Qd = 200 - 4P. Supply: Qs = -40 + 2P. Tax of $10 per unit on producers.
Solution:
(a) Before tax: 200 - 4P = -40 + 2P. 6P = 240. P* = $40, Q* = 40 units.
(b) With tax, supply shifts up by $10: Qs = -40 + 2(Pb - 10) = -60 + 2Pb.
New equilibrium: 200 - 4Pb = -60 + 2Pb. 6Pb = 260. Pb = $43.33. Qt = 200 - 4(43.33) = 26.67.
(c) Ps = Pb - 10 = $33.33.
(d) DWL = (1/2)(10)(40 - 26.67) = (1/2)(10)(13.33) = $66.67.
Tax revenue = 10 * 26.67 = $266.70.
Consumer burden: (43.33 - 40) * 26.67 = $88.89 (approximate).
Producer burden: (40 - 33.33) * 26.67 = $177.80 (approximate).
Producers bear more of the tax because supply is more inelastic than demand in this example.

Example 3 — Rent Control Analysis:
Problem: Equilibrium rent $1,200, equilibrium Q = 10,000. Price ceiling at $800. Qd at $800 = 14,000. Qs at $800 = 7,000.
Solution:
Shortage = Qd - Qs = 14,000 - 7,000 = 7,000 units.
Only 7,000 units are available at the controlled price.
Consumer surplus change: mixed — consumers who get apartments benefit (pay $800 instead of $1,200), but consumers between 7,000 and 10,000 are shut out entirely.
Producer surplus decreases unambiguously — landlords receive lower rent and supply fewer units.
Total surplus decreases — deadweight loss arises from the 3,000 units (10,000 - 7,000) that would have been traded at equilibrium but are not traded under the price ceiling.
Additional non-market costs: discrimination in allocation (landlords choose tenants by criteria other than willingness to pay), reduced maintenance incentives, black market activity.

PRACTICE PROBLEMS FOR EXAM PREPARATION

Problem A — Elasticity and Revenue:
A movie theater charges $12 per ticket and sells 500 tickets per night. If it raises the price to $15, it sells 350 tickets per night. (a) Calculate the price elasticity of demand. (b) Should the theater raise the price if its goal is to maximize ticket revenue?
Answer: (a) %dQ = (350-500)/425 = -35.3%, %dP = (15-12)/13.5 = 22.2%, Ed = -1.59 (elastic). (b) No — since demand is elastic, the price increase reduces total revenue. Before: $12*500 = $6,000. After: $15*350 = $5,250. Revenue falls by $750.

Problem B — Comparative Advantage:
Country X can produce 100 computers or 200 shirts per month. Country Y can produce 60 computers or 300 shirts per month. (a) Which country has a comparative advantage in computers? In shirts? (b) At what terms of trade would both countries benefit?
Answer: (a) OC of 1 computer: X = 2 shirts, Y = 5 shirts. X has comparative advantage in computers (lower OC). OC of 1 shirt: X = 0.5 computers, Y = 0.2 computers. Y has comparative advantage in shirts (lower OC). (b) Any price between 2 and 5 shirts per computer benefits both. For example, at 3 shirts per computer: X gives up 2 shirts to make a computer and trades for 3 (net gain 1 shirt); Y gives up 3 shirts and gets 1 computer that would have cost 5 shirts to produce (net gain 2 shirts).

Problem C — Price Floor:
The government sets a minimum wage of $15/hour when the equilibrium wage is $12/hour. Quantity of labor demanded at $15 = 8,000 workers. Quantity supplied at $15 = 12,000 workers. (a) Is this price floor binding? (b) What is the unemployment created? (c) Who benefits and who is harmed?
Answer: (a) Yes, $15 > $12 equilibrium, so the floor is binding. (b) Unemployment = Qs - Qd = 12,000 - 8,000 = 4,000 workers. (c) Workers who keep their jobs benefit (earn $15 instead of $12). Workers who lose their jobs (or can't find jobs) are harmed. Employers are harmed (pay higher wages, hire fewer workers). Deadweight loss exists from the reduced quantity of labor traded.

COMMON EXAM MISTAKES IN MICROECONOMICS

1. Confusing shift vs. movement along a curve. A change in the PRICE of the good causes movement along the curve. A change in any other factor (income, preferences, input costs, technology) shifts the entire curve.

2. Calculating elasticity without absolute value when classifying. Elasticity of demand is always negative (law of demand), but we use the absolute value to classify: |Ed| > 1 is elastic, |Ed| < 1 is inelastic.

3. Drawing non-binding price controls and expecting market effects. A price ceiling above equilibrium or a price floor below equilibrium is non-binding and has no effect on the market. Always check whether the control is binding before analyzing.

4. Assuming statutory incidence equals economic incidence. Who the tax is legally imposed on does not determine who bears the burden. The burden depends on relative elasticities.

Student swong_2026 is a sophomore economics major with an 88% in ECON 201 based on homework and participation. Midterm 1 is on October 10 and covers chapters 1-7. Exam format: 30 multiple-choice, 3 graphing/calculation problems, 90 minutes. Prof. Nkemelu emphasized graph-drawing skills in the review lecture. Study partner emorales_2026 plans to meet for additional practice after this session. Student plans to practice drawing supply-demand diagrams with tax wedges before the exam.
