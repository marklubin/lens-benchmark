[Turn 1 — 09:15:12 — azhang_2026]
hey! so i have quiz 2 coming up on friday (sept 12) and we just started integration by parts in calc 2. integration by parts is killing me lol, can you walk me through a few? like i know the formula kinda but i keep messing up the actual problems

[Turn 2 — 09:15:48 — StudyBuddy AI Tutor]
Hi Amy! Of course, I'd be happy to help you with integration by parts. Let's start with the foundation and then work through several examples together.

The core formula for integration by parts is:

$$\int u \, dv = uv - \int v \, du$$

This comes from the product rule for differentiation, essentially run in reverse. The idea is that you're choosing to split the integrand into two pieces — one piece that you'll call $u$ (which you'll differentiate) and one piece that you'll call $dv$ (which you'll integrate).

The key challenge is deciding **which part** of your integrand should be $u$ and which should be $dv$. For that, we use the **LIATE mnemonic** to help choose $u$. LIATE stands for:

- **L** — Logarithmic functions (e.g., $\ln x$, $\log x$)
- **I** — Inverse trigonometric functions (e.g., $\arctan x$, $\arcsin x$)
- **A** — Algebraic functions (e.g., $x^2$, $x^3 + 5x$)
- **T** — Trigonometric functions (e.g., $\sin x$, $\cos x$)
- **E** — Exponential functions (e.g., $e^x$, $2^x$)

The idea is that whichever function type appears **earlier** in LIATE should typically be your choice for $u$, because those functions tend to simplify when differentiated. Functions later in the list are usually better choices for $dv$ because they remain manageable when integrated.

For example, if your integrand has an algebraic piece and an exponential piece, the algebraic part (A) comes before exponential (E) in LIATE, so you'd let $u$ = the algebraic part.

Does that make sense so far? Want to try a specific problem?

[Turn 3 — 09:17:05 — azhang_2026]
yeah that makes sense. i remember prof delgado mentioning the LIATE thing in lecture but i honestly wasnt paying super close attention. can we do a concrete example? like what about the integral of x * e^x dx? the textbook (stewart calculus 9th ed) has that one but the solution goes kinda fast

[Turn 4 — 09:17:52 — StudyBuddy AI Tutor]
Great choice — that's a classic integration by parts problem. Let me work through $\int x e^x \, dx$ step by step.

**Step 1: Choose $u$ and $dv$.**

Using LIATE, $x$ is algebraic (A) and $e^x$ is exponential (E). Since A comes before E, we choose:

$$u = x \qquad dv = e^x \, dx$$

**Step 2: Compute $du$ and $v$.**

Differentiate $u$:
$$du = dx$$

Integrate $dv$:
$$v = \int e^x \, dx = e^x$$

(We don't need to add a constant of integration here — we'll add $C$ at the very end.)

**Step 3: Plug into the formula.**

$$\int x e^x \, dx = uv - \int v \, du$$

$$= x \cdot e^x - \int e^x \, dx$$

**Step 4: Evaluate the remaining integral.**

$$= xe^x - e^x + C$$

And that's the final answer:

$$\boxed{\int x e^x \, dx = xe^x - e^x + C}$$

You can verify by differentiating: $\frac{d}{dx}(xe^x - e^x + C) = e^x + xe^x - e^x = xe^x$ ✓

The key insight with this problem is that differentiating $x$ made it simpler ($x \to 1$), and integrating $e^x$ kept it the same ($e^x \to e^x$). That's exactly what LIATE helps you do — pick the $u$ that simplifies.

[Turn 5 — 09:19:21 — azhang_2026]
ok cool that makes a lot of sense. i think where i get confused is when you have to do integration by parts more than once, like when theres x squared instead of just x. can i try one? what about the integral of x^2 * sin(x) dx

[Turn 6 — 09:19:44 — StudyBuddy AI Tutor]
Yes, absolutely! That's a perfect problem to practice with — it requires applying integration by parts **twice** because of the $x^2$. Go ahead and set up the first application, and I'll check your work as you go. Show me your choice of $u$ and $dv$ for the first round.

[Turn 7 — 09:21:03 — azhang_2026]
ok so using LIATE, x^2 is algebraic and sin(x) is trig, so algebraic comes first

u = x^2    dv = sin(x) dx
du = 2x dx    v = -cos(x)

so plugging in:
integral of x^2 sin(x) dx = x^2 * (-cos(x)) - integral of (-cos(x)) * 2x dx
= -x^2 cos(x) + integral of 2x cos(x) dx

now i need to do integration by parts again on the integral of 2x cos(x) dx right?

[Turn 8 — 09:21:38 — StudyBuddy AI Tutor]
Exactly right! Your first application is perfect:

- $u = x^2$, $dv = \sin x \, dx$
- $du = 2x \, dx$, $v = -\cos x$

And you correctly got:

$$\int x^2 \sin x \, dx = -x^2 \cos x + \int 2x \cos x \, dx$$

Now yes, you need a second application of integration by parts for $\int 2x \cos x \, dx$. You can factor the 2 out front if you like, or keep it in. Go ahead and set it up!

[Turn 9 — 09:23:17 — azhang_2026]
ok for the second part, integral of 2x cos(x) dx:

u = 2x    dv = cos(x) dx
du = 2 dx    v = sin(x)

so:
integral of 2x cos(x) dx = 2x * sin(x) - integral of sin(x) * 2 dx
= 2x sin(x) - 2 * integral of sin(x) dx
= 2x sin(x) - 2 * (-cos(x))
= 2x sin(x) - 2cos(x)

wait no thats wrong. the negative of negative should give me a plus. let me redo:

= 2x sin(x) - 2*(-cos(x))
= 2x sin(x) + 2cos(x)

so putting it all together:
integral of x^2 sin(x) dx = -x^2 cos(x) + 2x sin(x) + 2cos(x) + C

[Turn 10 — 09:24:01 — StudyBuddy AI Tutor]
Nice work catching that! Let me walk through exactly what happened so the correction is clear.

In the second application, when you evaluated $\int \sin x \, dx = -\cos x$, you initially wrote:

$$2x \sin x - 2\cos x$$

But you needed $-2 \cdot (-\cos x)$, which gives $+2\cos x$. The negative distributes through the integral result. You caught it yourself, which is great.

Your final answer is correct:

$$\boxed{\int x^2 \sin x \, dx = -x^2 \cos x + 2x \sin x + 2\cos x + C}$$

You can verify by differentiating:
- $\frac{d}{dx}(-x^2 \cos x) = -2x\cos x + x^2 \sin x$
- $\frac{d}{dx}(2x \sin x) = 2\sin x + 2x\cos x$
- $\frac{d}{dx}(2\cos x) = -2\sin x$

Adding those up: $x^2 \sin x - 2x\cos x + 2\sin x + 2x\cos x - 2\sin x = x^2 \sin x$ ✓

Everything cancels beautifully to give back the original integrand. The key with repeated integration by parts is keeping careful track of signs at each step — that's where most errors happen.

[Turn 11 — 09:25:29 — azhang_2026]
ohhh i see where i messed up the sign, the negative distributes into the whole integral right? like the minus sign in front of the integral of v du applies to the RESULT of that integral, not just the first term

[Turn 12 — 09:25:55 — StudyBuddy AI Tutor]
Exactly! That's a very common source of errors. When you have:

$$uv - \int v \, du$$

That minus sign in front of the integral applies to the **entire result** of the integral, not just the first term. So if $\int v \, du$ evaluates to, say, $A + B$, then you get:

$$uv - (A + B) = uv - A - B$$

People often forget to distribute that negative sign, especially when the integral itself produces another negative (like $\int \sin x \, dx = -\cos x$). So you end up with $-(-\cos x) = +\cos x$, and missing that double negative is the #1 integration by parts mistake I see.

The fact that you caught it on your own is a really good sign — it means you're developing the instinct to double-check sign handling. That's a skill that will serve you well in all of Calculus II and beyond.

[Turn 13 — 09:27:08 — azhang_2026]
lol thanks. ok so i heard theres a shortcut for when you have to do integration by parts a bunch of times, like a table method or something? wait so for the tabular method do i always alternate + and -?

[Turn 14 — 09:27:42 — StudyBuddy AI Tutor]
Great question! Yes, the **tabular method** (also called the **tabular integration** method) is a shortcut for when you have an integrand that's a product of two functions where one of them **eventually differentiates to zero** (typically a polynomial) and the other is **easy to integrate repeatedly** (like $e^x$, $\sin x$, or $\cos x$).

Here's how it works:

1. Set up a table with three columns: **Signs**, **Derivatives of $u$** (the polynomial), and **Integrals of $dv$**.
2. In the Signs column, you **alternate** starting with $+$: $+$, $-$, $+$, $-$, ...
3. Differentiate $u$ repeatedly down the left column until you reach 0.
4. Integrate $dv$ repeatedly down the right column the same number of times.
5. Draw diagonal arrows from each derivative to the integral **one row below**.
6. Multiply along each diagonal and apply the corresponding sign.
7. The answer is the sum of all those products (plus $C$).

And yes, to answer your specific question: you **always alternate** $+$ and $-$ starting with $+$. This alternating sign pattern comes from the fact that each application of integration by parts introduces a negative sign.

Let me demonstrate with a meatier example to really show the power of this method. Let's do:

$$\int x^3 e^{2x} \, dx$$

Without the tabular method, this would require **three** applications of integration by parts (since $x^3$ needs to be differentiated three times to reach 0). That's a lot of bookkeeping. But with the table:

| Sign | Derivatives of $u = x^3$ | Integrals of $dv = e^{2x}\,dx$ |
|------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
| $+$  | $x^3$                    | $e^{2x}$                     |
| $-$  | $3x^2$                   | $\frac{1}{2}e^{2x}$          |
| $+$  | $6x$                     | $\frac{1}{4}e^{2x}$          |
| $-$  | $6$                      | $\frac{1}{8}e^{2x}$          |
| $+$  | $0$                      | $\frac{1}{16}e^{2x}$         |

Now connect diagonals (each derivative row to the integral one row below it):

$$\int x^3 e^{2x} \, dx = (+)(x^3)\left(\frac{1}{2}e^{2x}\right) + (-)(3x^2)\left(\frac{1}{4}e^{2x}\right) + (+)(6x)\left(\frac{1}{8}e^{2x}\right) + (-)(6)\left(\frac{1}{16}e^{2x}\right) + C$$

$$= \frac{x^3}{2}e^{2x} - \frac{3x^2}{4}e^{2x} + \frac{6x}{8}e^{2x} - \frac{6}{16}e^{2x} + C$$

Simplifying:

$$= \frac{x^3}{2}e^{2x} - \frac{3x^2}{4}e^{2x} + \frac{3x}{4}e^{2x} - \frac{3}{8}e^{2x} + C$$

You can factor out $\frac{e^{2x}}{8}$ if you want a tidy form:

$$= \frac{e^{2x}}{8}\left(4x^3 - 6x^2 + 6x - 3\right) + C$$

Doing this problem the "long way" with three separate applications of integration by parts would take much more writing and many more opportunities for sign errors. The tabular method compresses all of that into a single table.

[Turn 15 — 09:30:44 — azhang_2026]
wow that IS way faster. i just want to make sure i understand the setup tho. so in the table, the first row has the original u and the original dv right? and then i differentiate going DOWN the u column and integrate going DOWN the dv column? and the diagonal arrows go from each u row to the dv entry one row BELOW?

[Turn 16 — 09:31:08 — StudyBuddy AI Tutor]
That's exactly right. Let me be really explicit about the mechanics, because getting the arrows right is the whole point of the method:

1. **Row 0** (the top row): Contains your original $u$ and your original $dv$ (or really, the function you're integrating — some people write $e^{2x}$ rather than $e^{2x}dx$ in the column header for simplicity).

2. **Going down the left column**: Each row is the derivative of the row above. So for $x^3$, the column reads: $x^3$, $3x^2$, $6x$, $6$, $0$.

3. **Going down the right column**: Each row is the antiderivative of the row above. So for $e^{2x}$, the column reads: $e^{2x}$, $\frac{1}{2}e^{2x}$, $\frac{1}{4}e^{2x}$, $\frac{1}{8}e^{2x}$, $\frac{1}{16}e^{2x}$.

4. **Diagonal arrows**: Each arrow starts at a row in the **left column** and points to the entry **one row below** in the **right column**. So the arrow from $x^3$ points to $\frac{1}{2}e^{2x}$, the arrow from $3x^2$ points to $\frac{1}{4}e^{2x}$, and so on.

5. **Signs**: The first arrow is $+$, the second is $-$, then $+$, then $-$, alternating.

6. **You stop** when the left column hits 0. The row with 0 in the left column doesn't produce an arrow because 0 times anything is 0.

One common mistake students make is drawing the arrows horizontally (same row) instead of diagonally (one row down). If you do it horizontally, you'll get the wrong answer because you're essentially skipping the integration step. The diagonal is what encodes the integration.

Think of it this way: the standard integration by parts formula says you multiply $u$ by the integral of $dv$ — that's one differentiation and one integration, which is exactly what the diagonal captures.

[Turn 17 — 09:32:15 — azhang_2026]
ohh ok that makes perfect sense, the diagonal = one differentiation + one integration. cool. so the tabular method only works when one of the functions eventually becomes 0 when you keep differentiating? like it wouldnt work if both functions were like sin and e^x?

[Turn 18 — 09:32:42 — StudyBuddy AI Tutor]
Exactly right. The tabular method in its basic form works best when one factor differentiates to zero in finitely many steps. That typically means:

- The $u$ factor is a **polynomial** (since any polynomial of degree $n$ reaches 0 after $n+1$ derivatives).
- The $dv$ factor is something you can **integrate repeatedly** without too much trouble — $e^{ax}$, $\sin(ax)$, $\cos(ax)$, etc.

If you tried it with $e^x \cdot \sin x$, neither function differentiates to zero. The table would go on forever! For those types of integrals (two "cycling" functions), you use a different technique — the "solve for the integral" trick, where you apply integration by parts twice and then notice the original integral reappears on the right side, allowing you to solve for it algebraically. That's actually covered in Section 7.1 of Stewart as well.

But for MATH 202, the vast majority of integration by parts problems on quizzes and exams involve a polynomial times an exponential or trigonometric function, so the tabular method is extremely useful.

[Turn 19 — 09:33:30 — azhang_2026]
ok makes sense! can i try a problem on my own? let me try the integral of (x^2 + 3x) * cos(x) dx

[Turn 20 — 09:33:48 — StudyBuddy AI Tutor]
Go for it! Show me your setup and I'll check your work. Since $(x^2 + 3x)$ is a degree-2 polynomial, you could use either the standard method (two rounds of integration by parts) or try the tabular method. Your choice!

[Turn 21 — 09:35:11 — azhang_2026]
ill use the tabular method since we just learned it:

Signs | Derivatives of u = x^2 + 3x | Integrals of dv = cos(x) dx
+     | x^2 + 3x                      | cos(x)
-     | 2x + 3                         | sin(x)
+     | 2                              | -cos(x)
-     | 0                              | -sin(x)

so connecting diagonals:
= (+)(x^2 + 3x)(sin(x)) + (-)(2x+3)(-cos(x)) + (+)(2)(-sin(x)) + C
= (x^2 + 3x)sin(x) + (2x+3)cos(x) - 2sin(x) + C

is that right?

[Turn 22 — 09:35:52 — StudyBuddy AI Tutor]
That's perfect! Let me verify:

$$\int (x^2 + 3x)\cos x \, dx = (x^2 + 3x)\sin x + (2x + 3)\cos x - 2\sin x + C$$

We can check by differentiating:
- $\frac{d}{dx}[(x^2+3x)\sin x] = (2x+3)\sin x + (x^2+3x)\cos x$
- $\frac{d}{dx}[(2x+3)\cos x] = 2\cos x - (2x+3)\sin x$
- $\frac{d}{dx}[-2\sin x] = -2\cos x$

Sum: $(2x+3)\sin x + (x^2+3x)\cos x + 2\cos x - (2x+3)\sin x - 2\cos x = (x^2+3x)\cos x$ ✓

Everything cancels to give you back the original integrand. You handled the tabular method really well on that one, and your sign handling was flawless. Nice job!

[Turn 23 — 09:36:45 — azhang_2026]
nice!! ok let me try another one without help. what about integral of x * ln(x) dx? actually wait this one is different bc the ln(x) doesnt differentiate to zero and x is the "easy" part to integrate... but LIATE says L comes before A so u should be ln(x)

[Turn 24 — 09:37:02 — StudyBuddy AI Tutor]
Good thinking! You're right that this one doesn't fit the tabular method since $\ln x$ doesn't differentiate to zero (it gives $1/x$, then $-1/x^2$, etc.). But LIATE still guides you correctly: $\ln x$ is Logarithmic (L), which comes before Algebraic (A), so you choose:

$$u = \ln x, \qquad dv = x \, dx$$

Go ahead and work it out!

[Turn 25 — 09:38:40 — azhang_2026]
ok:

u = ln(x)    dv = x dx
du = 1/x dx    v = x^2/2

integral of x ln(x) dx = ln(x) * x^2/2 - integral of (x^2/2)(1/x) dx
= (x^2/2)ln(x) - integral of x/2 dx
= (x^2/2)ln(x) - x^2/4 + C

[Turn 26 — 09:39:05 — StudyBuddy AI Tutor]
Excellent — that is exactly right!

$$\int x \ln x \, dx = \frac{x^2}{2}\ln x - \frac{x^2}{4} + C$$

Quick verification: $\frac{d}{dx}\left[\frac{x^2}{2}\ln x - \frac{x^2}{4}\right] = x\ln x + \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{2} = x\ln x$ ✓

Notice how choosing $u = \ln x$ was critical here. If you had tried $u = x$ and $dv = \ln x \, dx$, you'd need to integrate $\ln x$, which is itself an integration by parts problem. LIATE steered you to the cleaner setup. You got this one completely on your own — really solid work.

[Turn 27 — 09:40:12 — azhang_2026]
ok one more. integral of e^x * cos(x) dx. this is one of the cycling ones you mentioned right?

[Turn 28 — 09:40:33 — StudyBuddy AI Tutor]
Exactly! This is the type where neither function differentiates to zero, so the tabular method won't terminate. Instead, you use the "solve for the integral" technique. Let me outline the approach and you can try filling in the algebra.

Let $I = \int e^x \cos x \, dx$.

**First application of integration by parts:**

Let $u = \cos x$, $dv = e^x dx$. Then $du = -\sin x \, dx$, $v = e^x$.

$$I = e^x \cos x - \int e^x(-\sin x)\, dx = e^x \cos x + \int e^x \sin x \, dx$$

**Second application** on the remaining integral:

Let $u = \sin x$, $dv = e^x dx$. Then $du = \cos x \, dx$, $v = e^x$.

$$\int e^x \sin x \, dx = e^x \sin x - \int e^x \cos x \, dx = e^x \sin x - I$$

**Now substitute back:**

$$I = e^x \cos x + e^x \sin x - I$$

$$2I = e^x(\cos x + \sin x)$$

$$I = \frac{e^x(\cos x + \sin x)}{2} + C$$

The clever trick is recognizing that the original integral $I$ reappears after two rounds of integration by parts, and then you solve for it like a regular algebraic equation. This technique shows up whenever you have $e^{ax}$ multiplied by $\sin(bx)$ or $\cos(bx)$.

This might be on your Quiz 2 — it's a common type in Section 7.1.

[Turn 29 — 09:42:55 — azhang_2026]
ok that is really cool actually. speaking of the quiz, what types of integrals do you think will be on quiz 2? prof delgado didn't really say what to focus on specifically

also what sections should i review? we've covered like 7.1 through part of 7.4 so far

[Turn 30 — 09:43:38 — StudyBuddy AI Tutor]
I can't access specific exam content or your instructor's quiz, so I don't know what particular problems Prof. Delgado will include. However, based on the syllabus topics you've described — Sections 7.1 through 7.4 of Stewart Calculus, 9th edition — here are the core techniques you'd want to be comfortable with:

**Section 7.1 — Integration by Parts:**
- Products of polynomials with $e^x$, $\sin x$, or $\cos x$
- Integrands involving $\ln x$
- The "cycling" integrals ($e^x \sin x$, $e^x \cos x$) where you solve for $I$
- Definite integrals using integration by parts (same formula but with bounds)

**Section 7.2 — Trigonometric Integrals:**
- $\int \sin^m x \cos^n x \, dx$ — strategies depend on whether $m$ or $n$ is odd
- $\int \tan^m x \sec^n x \, dx$
- Using half-angle identities when both powers are even

**Section 7.3 — Trigonometric Substitution:**
- Recognizing $\sqrt{a^2 - x^2}$, $\sqrt{a^2 + x^2}$, $\sqrt{x^2 - a^2}$ patterns
- Setting up the substitution and converting back to $x$

**Section 7.4 — Partial Fractions:**
- Decomposing rational functions into simpler fractions
- Distinct linear factors, repeated linear factors, irreducible quadratic factors

For quiz prep, I'd recommend working 3-5 problems from each section. The end-of-section exercises in Stewart are great practice, and you can check the odd-numbered answers in the back. Focus especially on integration by parts and trigonometric integrals since those were likely covered most recently.

Would you like to work through any problems from Sections 7.2–7.4, or do you feel solid on integration by parts for now?

[Turn 31 — 09:45:20 — azhang_2026]
no i think im good on integration by parts now! i might come back tomorrow for help with trig substitution tho, that section is rough. this is way better than the youtube videos i was watching, ty!

[Turn 32 — 09:45:42 — StudyBuddy AI Tutor]
You're very welcome, Amy! You did really well today — you worked through 5 integration problems and solved 3 of them completely independently. Your instinct for catching sign errors is improving too, which is one of the hardest parts of integration by parts.

Good luck on Quiz 2 this Friday! And definitely come back if you want to review trigonometric substitution — that's a topic where working through examples step by step really helps.

Have a great rest of your day!

— AUTOMATED SESSION NOTES —

This is session 5 for student azhang_2026 (Amy Zhang). Account was created on 2025-08-22. Student is a sophomore in the Computer Science program. Session opened at 09:15:00 UTC. Student connected from the university campus network (IP block 10.128.x.x, campus WiFi). No VPN or proxy detected.

Student requested help with integration by parts for MATH 202, Calculus II, Fall 2025, taught by Prof. Delgado. Student referenced upcoming Weekly Quiz 2, scheduled for 2025-09-12. Primary reference textbook is Stewart Calculus, 9th edition. Student noted difficulty with the topic and requested guided examples before attempting independent practice.

Tutor presented the integration by parts formula and the LIATE mnemonic for selecting the $u$ component of the integrand. Tutor demonstrated a complete worked example of $\int x e^x \, dx$ using $u = x$, $dv = e^x dx$, $du = dx$, $v = e^x$, producing the result $xe^x - e^x + C$. Student followed the demonstration and expressed understanding.

Student then attempted $\int x^2 \sin x \, dx$ independently, applying integration by parts twice. In the first application, student correctly set up $u = x^2$, $dv = \sin x \, dx$ and obtained $-x^2 \cos x + \int 2x \cos x \, dx$. In the second application, student set up $u = 2x$, $dv = \cos x \, dx$ but initially made a sign error when evaluating $-2 \cdot \int \sin x \, dx = -2(-\cos x)$. Student wrote the intermediate result as $-2\cos x$ instead of $+2\cos x$. Student self-corrected the error and arrived at the correct final answer: $-x^2 \cos x + 2x \sin x + 2\cos x + C$. Tutor confirmed correctness with derivative verification.

Student asked about the tabular integration method as an alternative for repeated integration by parts. Tutor explained the three-column tabular method (signs, derivatives, integrals) with alternating $+/-$ signs and demonstrated the complete technique using $\int x^3 e^{2x} \, dx$. Tutor produced the tabular layout showing derivatives of $x^3$ down to 0 alongside repeated integrals of $e^{2x}$, yielding the factored result $\frac{e^{2x}}{8}(4x^3 - 6x^2 + 6x - 3) + C$.

Student worked through $\int (x^2 + 3x)\cos x \, dx$ using the tabular method independently and correctly obtained $(x^2 + 3x)\sin x + (2x + 3)\cos x - 2\sin x + C$. Tutor verified via differentiation. Student then solved $\int x \ln x \, dx$ independently using standard integration by parts with $u = \ln x$, correctly obtaining $\frac{x^2}{2}\ln x - \frac{x^2}{4} + C$. Tutor confirmed with differentiation check.

Tutor demonstrated the "solve for the integral" cycling technique for $\int e^x \cos x \, dx$, showing how the original integral $I$ reappears after two applications, leading to the algebraic solution $I = \frac{e^x(\cos x + \sin x)}{2} + C$.

Student asked what types of integrals would appear on Quiz 2. Tutor stated it cannot access specific exam content but provided a study guide covering Sections 7.1–7.4 of Stewart Calculus (integration by parts, trigonometric integrals, trigonometric substitution, partial fractions) based on the syllabus topics the student described.

Session concluded at 09:45 UTC. Student rated the session 5/5 and expressed preference for the tutoring session over video resources. Student mentioned the possibility of returning the following day for help with trigonometric substitution (Section 7.3).

Pedagogical notes: Student demonstrates strong computational skills and good conceptual understanding of integration techniques. Self-correction of sign errors mid-problem is a positive learning behavior. Student transitioned from guided examples to independent practice within the session, completing 3 of 5 problems without tutor assistance. The session followed a productive scaffolding pattern: tutor demonstration, guided practice, independent practice with verification. No academic integrity concerns were observed. Student did not request full solutions to homework or exam problems; all work was practice-oriented with the student showing their own steps.

Recommendation for next session: If student returns for trigonometric substitution, begin with the geometric interpretation (right triangle diagrams) before moving to algebraic substitution mechanics, as this student appears to benefit from visual/conceptual framing before procedural work.
