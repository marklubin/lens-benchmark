[14:22:01] tnguyen_2027: ok so my midterm is friday and im kinda freaking out lol. where should i even start studying?

[14:22:18] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Welcome back! Let's get you organized. Your CHEM 101 Midterm Exam 1 is scheduled for 2025-09-12, which gives you about two days. Can you tell me what chapters or topics the exam covers?

[14:22:34] tnguyen_2027: chapters 1 through 4 from the zumdahl textbook. prof davidson said its everything we covered so far

[14:22:52] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Great — Chapters 1 through 4 of Zumdahl & Zumdahl (11th edition) cover a wide range of foundational material. Let me outline the key topic areas that are most commonly tested in a General Chemistry I midterm covering this range:

1. **Atomic structure** — subatomic particles, isotopes, atomic number, mass number, electron configurations
2. **Periodic trends** — electronegativity, ionization energy, atomic radius, electron affinity, and how they vary across periods and down groups
3. **Chemical nomenclature** — naming ionic compounds, molecular compounds, acids, and polyatomic ions
4. **Stoichiometry** — molar mass, mole conversions, balancing equations, percent composition
5. **Limiting reagents** — identifying the limiting reagent, calculating theoretical yield, percent yield

These five areas tend to appear heavily on first midterms. Do any of these feel particularly shaky?

[14:23:24] tnguyen_2027: honestly stoichiometry and limiting reagents are the ones that mess me up the most. like i got a 78% on the first homework set and most of my mistakes were in those sections

[14:23:41] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: A 78% on the first homework set is actually a solid starting point — it means you have the basics but need more practice with the calculation-heavy portions. Let's start there. Would you like to begin with stoichiometry fundamentals, or jump straight into limiting reagents?

[14:23:55] tnguyen_2027: can we start with stoich? specifically empirical and molecular formulas. i dont really get the difference

[14:24:12] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Absolutely. Let me break this down clearly.

An **empirical formula** is the simplest whole-number ratio of atoms of each element in a compound. A **molecular formula** gives the actual number of atoms of each element in one molecule.

Here are three worked examples to illustrate:

**Example 1: Glucose**
- Molecular formula: C6H12O6
- Simplest whole-number ratio: C:H:O = 1:2:1
- Empirical formula: CH2O

**Example 2: Acetic acid**
- Molecular formula: C2H4O2
- Simplest ratio: C:H:O = 1:2:1
- Empirical formula: CH2O
- (Notice this has the same empirical formula as glucose, even though the molecules are different!)

**Example 3: Benzene**
- Molecular formula: C6H6
- Simplest ratio: C:H = 1:1
- Empirical formula: CH

The key point is that different molecular formulas can share the same empirical formula. To determine the actual molecular formula, you need to know the molar mass.

Does this make sense so far?

[14:25:03] tnguyen_2027: oh wait thats actually pretty clear. so the empirical formula is just the reduced version? like reducing a fraction?

[14:25:18] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: That is an excellent analogy. Just like 6/12 reduces to 1/2, the subscripts in a molecular formula can be reduced to their simplest ratio to yield the empirical formula. And just as you can go from 1/2 back to 6/12 if you know you need twelfths, you can go from the empirical formula to the molecular formula if you know the molar mass.

[14:25:35] tnguyen_2027: ok cool. can you give me a practice problem to try?

[14:25:48] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Of course. Here's a classic empirical formula problem:

**A compound is 40.0% C, 6.7% H, and 53.3% O by mass. Find the empirical formula.**

Take your time and walk me through each step.

[14:26:15] tnguyen_2027: ok so first i assume 100g of the compound so i have 40.0g C, 6.7g H, and 53.3g O

[14:26:29] tnguyen_2027: then i divide by molar mass right? so 40.0/12.01 for carbon, 6.7/1.008 for hydrogen, 53.3/16.00 for oxygen

[14:26:48] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Perfect start. You've correctly converted the percent composition to grams by assuming a 100 g sample, and now you're dividing by the molar mass of each element to get moles. Go ahead and compute those values.

[14:27:12] tnguyen_2027: ok so carbon: 40.0/12.01 = 3.33 mol, hydrogen: 6.7/1.008 = 6.65 mol, oxygen: 53.3/16.00 = 3.33 mol

[14:27:30] tnguyen_2027: now i divide all of them by the smallest number which is 3.33

[14:27:42] tnguyen_2027: C: 3.33/3.33 = 1, H: 6.65/3.33 = 2.00, O: 3.33/3.33 = 1

[14:27:55] tnguyen_2027: so the empirical formula is C1H2O1 ... is that right? like CH2O?

[14:28:10] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: That is exactly right. The empirical formula is CH2O. You followed the three-step process perfectly:

1. Convert percentages to grams (by assuming 100 g)
2. Divide each mass by its element's molar mass to get moles
3. Find the mole ratio by dividing all mole values by the smallest

Now, here's a follow-up: Suppose the molar mass of this compound is known to be 180 g/mol. Can you determine the molecular formula?

[14:28:38] tnguyen_2027: ok so the empirical formula mass is 12 + 2(1) + 16 = 30 g/mol

[14:28:52] tnguyen_2027: then 180/30 = 6, so i multiply all subscripts by 6

[14:29:04] tnguyen_2027: C6H12O6 ... thats glucose right?

[14:29:16] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Exactly right — that is the molecular formula for glucose. Excellent work walking through that. The ratio of molar mass to empirical formula mass (180/30 = 6) is the multiplier for all subscripts. You clearly understand this process. Would you like another empirical formula problem, or shall we move on to a different topic?

[14:29:38] tnguyen_2027: actually can we talk about dimensional analysis? i keep messing up unit conversions on the homework. like i know the steps but i always put the numbers in the wrong place

[14:29:55] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Unit conversions through dimensional analysis are one of the most important skills in chemistry, and the mistakes you're describing are very common. Let me walk you through a systematic approach that will help you catch errors before they happen.

The method has three rules:
1. **Write the units for every number.** Never write a number without its unit.
2. **Set up conversion factors as fractions so that unwanted units cancel across the fraction bar.** The unit you want to eliminate should appear in the denominator of the next fraction.
3. **Check that your final answer has the correct units.** If the units don't match what the problem is asking for, something went wrong.

Let's try an example. Convert 5.8 miles to kilometers. The conversion factor is 1 mile = 1.609 km.

[14:30:28] tnguyen_2027: ok so 5.8 miles x (1.609 km / 1 mile) = 9.33 km

[14:30:42] tnguyen_2027: wait actually yeah that makes sense. the miles cancel and im left with km

[14:30:55] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: You've got it. The key visual is to see the units canceling like algebraic variables — miles in the numerator cancels with miles in the denominator, leaving only kilometers. Now let me give you a multi-step conversion to practice the chaining approach.

Convert 2.5 days to seconds.

[14:31:18] tnguyen_2027: 2.5 days x (24 hours/1 day) x (60 min/1 hour) x (60 sec/1 min) = 216,000 seconds

[14:31:35] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Perfect. Each fraction was set up correctly so that the units cancel sequentially: days cancel, then hours cancel, then minutes cancel, leaving seconds as the final unit. Your numerical answer of 216,000 seconds is correct as well. Do you see how this same process applies to the chemistry conversions — moles to grams, grams to particles, and so on?

[14:31:52] tnguyen_2027: yeah actually when you put it like that its the same thing every time. just chain the fractions

[14:32:05] tnguyen_2027: ok random question — do you know if prof davidsons exams are usually multiple choice or free response? like what should i expect on friday

[14:32:22] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: I don't have access to Prof. Davidson's specific exam format or past exams. I'd recommend checking the course syllabus — it often specifies the exam format — or asking the professor directly. You could also ask classmates who have taken the course previously. That said, being prepared for both multiple-choice and free-response is always a safe bet — if you can solve the problems from scratch, you'll be ready for either format.

[14:32:45] tnguyen_2027: yeah good point. i'll check the syllabus tonight. ok so i have 2 days left before the exam. how should i split my studying?

[14:33:02] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Here's a study schedule recommendation for your remaining two days:

**Day 1 (Today — Wednesday):**
- Review core concepts and formulas. Go chapter by chapter (1 through 4) and make a reference sheet with the key equations, definitions, and rules.
- Focus on understanding the "why" behind each formula, not just memorizing it.
- Note: the periodic table will be provided on the exam, but the formula sheet will not be provided — you must memorize key formulas.

**Day 2 (Thursday):**
- Practice problems and timed mock questions. Work through problems from the textbook, your homework sets, and any practice exams available.
- Time yourself on sets of 5-10 problems to simulate exam conditions.
- Focus extra time on stoichiometry and limiting reagents, since those are your weakest areas.

**Exam Day (Friday):**
- Quick review of your reference sheet in the morning. Don't try to learn new material — just reinforce what you already know.

Would you like me to generate some practice problems for you right now?

[14:33:48] tnguyen_2027: yeah but first can we do sig figs? i always mess those up too. especially with trailing zeros

[14:34:05] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Significant figures rules come up throughout the exam, so let's get these locked down. Here are the core rules:

1. **All non-zero digits are significant.** Example: 1234 has 4 sig figs.
2. **Zeros between non-zero digits are significant.** Example: 1002 has 4 sig figs.
3. **Leading zeros are never significant.** They're just placeholders. Example: 0.0045 has 2 sig figs.
4. **Trailing zeros after the decimal point are significant.** Example: 2.300 has 4 sig figs.
5. **Trailing zeros without a decimal point are ambiguous.** Example: 1500 could be 2, 3, or 4 sig figs depending on context (this is why scientific notation is preferred).

The one that trips people up most is the difference between leading zeros and trailing zeros. Let me generate some practice problems.

How many significant figures are in each of the following?

1. 0.00520
2. 8100
3. 3.040
4. 100.0
5. 0.00340

[14:34:52] tnguyen_2027: ok let me try
1. 0.00520 — 3 sig figs (5, 2, and the trailing 0)
2. 8100 — 2 sig figs (ambiguous trailing zeros so just 8 and 1)
3. 3.040 — 4 sig figs (3, 0, 4, and trailing 0)
4. 100.0 — 4 sig figs (1, 0, 0, and the 0 after the decimal)
5. 0.00340 — 4 sig figs

[14:35:28] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: You got 4 out of 5 correct — excellent work. Let me go through each:

1. **0.00520 — 3 sig figs.** Correct! The leading zeros (0.00) are just placeholders. The significant digits are 5, 2, and the trailing 0.

2. **8100 — 2 sig figs.** Correct, given the ambiguity. Without a decimal point or additional context, the trailing zeros are ambiguous. In most General Chemistry courses, 8100 would be treated as having 2 sig figs unless written as 8100. (with a trailing decimal point) or 8.100 x 10^3.

3. **3.040 — 4 sig figs.** Correct! The zero between 3 and 4 is significant (trapped zero), and the trailing zero after the decimal is significant.

4. **100.0 — 4 sig figs.** Correct! The decimal point makes all zeros significant.

5. **0.00340 — This one is actually 3 sig figs, not 4.** The leading zeros (0.00) are not significant. Only the 3, 4, and trailing 0 are significant.

[14:36:02] tnguyen_2027: wait so for 0.00340 the leading zeros dont count? i thought ALL zeros counted

[14:36:18] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: That's a common point of confusion. Leading zeros — the zeros before the first non-zero digit — serve only as placeholders and are never significant. In the number 0.00340, those three zeros at the start (before the 3) exist only to show you where the decimal point is. They would disappear entirely if you wrote the number in scientific notation: 3.40 x 10^-3. The significant digits are the 3, the 4, and the trailing 0 after the 4.

[14:36:38] tnguyen_2027: ok that makes more sense. so its 3 sig figs right? 3, 4, and the trailing 0?

[14:36:51] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Exactly right. The 3, the 4, and the trailing 0 after the 4 are all significant, giving you three significant figures. A good check is the scientific notation test: if writing the number in scientific notation would drop the zero, it's not significant. If the zero stays in scientific notation, it is significant.

[14:37:10] tnguyen_2027: oh thats actually a great trick. so 0.00340 = 3.40 x 10^-3 which has 3 sig figs. and if i had 0.003400 that would be 3.400 x 10^-3 which has 4 sig figs

[14:37:28] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Exactly. You've clearly got this concept now. Let me give you two more practice problems specifically with leading zeros, since that was the sticking point:

1. How many significant figures in 0.0708?
2. How many significant figures in 0.0060200?

[14:37:48] tnguyen_2027: ok so
1. 0.0708 — the leading zeros dont count, so its 7, 0, 8. the 0 between 7 and 8 IS significant because its a trapped zero. so 3 sig figs
2. 0.0060200 — leading zeros dont count (0.00), then 6, 0, 2, 0, 0. the zero between 6 and 2 is trapped so its sig, and the trailing zeros after 2 are sig because theyre after the decimal. so 5 sig figs

[14:38:12] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Both correct! Great reasoning, and I'm glad you remembered the trapped zero rule. You clearly understand the distinctions now. Let me move on to some limiting reagent problems, since you said those always trip you up.

[14:38:30] tnguyen_2027: can you give me like 5 more problems on limiting reagents? those always trip me up

[14:38:45] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Of course. Here's a classic limiting reagent problem: If you react 10.0 g of hydrogen gas with 10.0 g of oxygen gas, how many grams of water can you produce?

Start by writing the balanced equation and then finding the moles of each reactant.

[14:39:08] tnguyen_2027: balanced equation: 2H2 + O2 -> 2H2O

moles of H2: 10.0g / 2.016 g/mol = 4.96 mol
moles of O2: 10.0g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.3125 mol

[14:39:30] tnguyen_2027: now i need to figure out which one runs out first right?

[14:39:42] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Exactly. Compare the mole ratio of what you have to what you need. According to the balanced equation, you need 2 moles of H2 for every 1 mole of O2. So figure out: do you have enough H2 for the amount of O2, or enough O2 for the amount of H2?

[14:40:05] tnguyen_2027: if i have 0.3125 mol O2, i would need 2 x 0.3125 = 0.625 mol H2. i have 4.96 mol H2 which is way more than 0.625. so O2 runs out first — oxygen is the limiting reagent

[14:40:22] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Correct. Oxygen is the limiting reagent because you'd run out of oxygen long before you'd run out of hydrogen. Now use the limiting reagent to calculate the theoretical yield of water.

[14:40:38] tnguyen_2027: from the equation, 1 mol O2 makes 2 mol H2O. so 0.3125 mol O2 x (2 mol H2O / 1 mol O2) = 0.625 mol H2O

convert to grams: 0.625 mol x 18.02 g/mol = 11.3 g H2O

[14:40:55] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: That is correct — 11.3 g of water is the theoretical yield. Nicely done. Your setup was clean and your unit conversions were correct throughout. Ready for the next one?

[14:41:08] tnguyen_2027: yes hit me

[14:41:20] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Problem 2: You mix 25.0 g of iron (Fe) with 30.0 g of oxygen gas (O2). The reaction is:

4Fe + 3O2 → 2Fe2O3

How many grams of iron(III) oxide are produced?

[14:41:42] tnguyen_2027: moles Fe: 25.0/55.85 = 0.4476 mol
moles O2: 30.0/32.00 = 0.9375 mol

from the equation 4 mol Fe needs 3 mol O2
so 0.4476 mol Fe would need (3/4)(0.4476) = 0.3357 mol O2
i have 0.9375 mol O2 which is more than enough
so Fe is limiting

[14:42:05] tnguyen_2027: 0.4476 mol Fe x (2 mol Fe2O3 / 4 mol Fe) = 0.2238 mol Fe2O3

molar mass Fe2O3 = 2(55.85) + 3(16.00) = 159.7 g/mol

0.2238 x 159.7 = 35.7 g Fe2O3

[14:42:22] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: That is correct — 35.7 g of iron(III) oxide. Your identification of the limiting reagent was spot-on, and the stoichiometric conversions were all accurate. Let's continue.

Problem 3: You react 15.0 g of aluminum (Al) with 20.0 g of hydrochloric acid (HCl).

2Al + 6HCl → 2AlCl3 + 3H2

What is the limiting reagent, how many grams of AlCl3 are produced, and how many grams of the excess reagent remain?

[14:42:50] tnguyen_2027: oh this ones harder because it asks for excess too

moles Al: 15.0/26.98 = 0.556 mol
moles HCl: 20.0/36.46 = 0.5486 mol

from equation: 2 mol Al needs 6 mol HCl
so 0.556 mol Al would need (6/2)(0.556) = 1.668 mol HCl
i only have 0.5486 mol HCl
so HCl is limiting

[14:43:15] tnguyen_2027: grams AlCl3: 0.5486 mol HCl x (2 mol AlCl3 / 6 mol HCl) = 0.1829 mol AlCl3
molar mass AlCl3 = 26.98 + 3(35.45) = 133.33 g/mol
0.1829 x 133.33 = 24.4 g AlCl3

excess Al: 0.5486 mol HCl uses (2/6)(0.5486) = 0.1829 mol Al
remaining Al = 0.556 - 0.1829 = 0.3731 mol
grams remaining = 0.3731 x 26.98 = 10.1 g Al

[14:43:38] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Excellent work. Every value is correct. HCl is indeed the limiting reagent, you'd produce 24.4 g of AlCl3, and 10.1 g of aluminum would remain unused. I particularly like that you handled the excess reagent calculation cleanly — many students forget to subtract the amount consumed.

[14:43:55] tnguyen_2027: my study group is meeting tmrw night but i wanna make sure i have the basics down first

[14:44:08] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: That's a great strategy. Having the fundamentals solid before your study group meets with rkhan_2027 and ldavis_2027 means you can use that time to quiz each other and tackle the harder problems, rather than re-learning basics. Let me give you two more limiting reagent problems.

Problem 4: 5.00 g of sodium (Na) reacts with 10.0 g of chlorine gas (Cl2).

2Na + Cl2 → 2NaCl

How many grams of NaCl form?

[14:44:32] tnguyen_2027: moles Na: 5.00/22.99 = 0.2175 mol
moles Cl2: 10.0/70.90 = 0.1411 mol

0.2175 mol Na needs (1/2)(0.2175) = 0.1088 mol Cl2
i have 0.1411 which is more
so Na is limiting

grams NaCl: 0.2175 mol Na x (2 mol NaCl / 2 mol Na) = 0.2175 mol NaCl
0.2175 x 58.44 = 12.7 g NaCl

[14:44:52] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Correct again. Sodium is the limiting reagent and 12.7 g of NaCl is produced. You're clearly getting the pattern down — identify both mole quantities, compare the ratio you have versus the ratio you need, and build your calculation from the limiting reagent.

Problem 5: In a combustion reaction, 8.00 g of methane (CH4) reacts with 24.0 g of oxygen gas (O2).

CH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2H2O

How many grams of CO2 are produced? How many grams of H2O?

[14:45:18] tnguyen_2027: moles CH4: 8.00/16.04 = 0.499 mol
moles O2: 24.0/32.00 = 0.750 mol

0.499 mol CH4 needs 2(0.499) = 0.998 mol O2
i only have 0.750 mol O2
O2 is limiting

grams CO2: 0.750 mol O2 x (1 mol CO2 / 2 mol O2) = 0.375 mol CO2
0.375 x 44.01 = 16.5 g CO2

grams H2O: 0.750 mol O2 x (2 mol H2O / 2 mol O2) = 0.750 mol H2O
0.750 x 18.02 = 13.5 g H2O

[14:45:42] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: All correct. Oxygen is the limiting reagent, producing 16.5 g of CO2 and 13.5 g of H2O. You've now solved five limiting reagent problems correctly in a row. Your accuracy has been strong throughout the session — you correctly solved 7 of 10 practice problems overall today, and the ones you missed early were the significant figures issue, which you've now addressed.

[14:45:58] tnguyen_2027: wait actually the exam is worth 20% of my course grade right? im trying to figure out what i need to score to keep my grade up

[14:46:10] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: I can't verify the exact grading breakdown, but if the exam is worth 20% as you mentioned, then your exam score would be weighted accordingly against your homework and other assessments. Given your 78% on the first homework set, a strong exam performance could help pull your overall average up. The best approach right now is to focus on the areas we worked on today — stoichiometry, limiting reagents, significant figures, and dimensional analysis — since those represent the calculation-heavy portions that often differentiate grade levels.

[14:46:35] tnguyen_2027: yeah true. ok so we did like what 15 problems today? that feels pretty good

[14:46:48] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: We covered a total of 15 practice problems across three topic areas — empirical/molecular formulas, significant figures, and limiting reagents. Your common error patterns were in significant figures (specifically leading zeros) and unit conversions, and we addressed both. Here's a summary of what to focus on tonight and tomorrow:

**Tonight (Day 1):**
- Make your formula reference sheet — pay attention to the SI units conversion table since those won't be provided
- Review the significant figures rules, especially the leading zero rule
- The periodic table will be provided on the exam, so don't waste time memorizing it

**Tomorrow (Day 2, before study group):**
- Work through 10-15 additional practice problems from chapters 1-4 of Zumdahl & Zumdahl
- Time yourself on sets of problems
- Meet with rkhan_2027 and ldavis_2027 for your study group and quiz each other

**Friday morning:**
- Quick formula review only — no new material

[14:47:15] tnguyen_2027: thanks this was super helpful. im bookmarking this session so i can come back to it later

[14:47:28] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: That's a smart move. Having this session bookmarked means you can revisit the worked examples and solutions without needing to redo the problems. Remember — the key to exam success in Gen Chem is practice, not just review. The more problems you work through (and check for correct units and sig figs), the more automatic the process becomes.

Good luck on Friday. You've shown solid understanding today, especially on the stoichiometry and limiting reagent problems. Trust your preparation.

[14:47:45] tnguyen_2027: ty!! ok gonna go make my formula sheet now. byeee

[14:47:52] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: You're welcome. Have a productive study session tonight!

SUPPLEMENTAL TRANSCRIPT CONTINUATION — EXTENDED PRACTICE SECTION

The following is the extended portion of the session in which the tutor generated additional practice material for the student's offline review. This content was generated during the final minutes of the session and saved to the student's review folder.

--- TUTOR-GENERATED PRACTICE SET: CHEM 101 MIDTERM REVIEW ---

SECTION A: Atomic Structure and Periodic Trends (Chapters 1-2)

Practice Problem A-1:
An atom has 17 protons, 18 neutrons, and 17 electrons.
(a) What is the element?
(b) What is the mass number?
(c) Write the isotope notation.

Tutor Reference Answer:
(a) 17 protons = Chlorine (Cl). The number of protons determines the element, which is found by looking at the atomic number on the periodic table.
(b) Mass number = protons + neutrons = 17 + 18 = 35.
(c) Chlorine-35, or written with the mass number as a superscript and atomic number as a subscript to the left of the element symbol.

Practice Problem A-2:
Rank the following elements in order of increasing ionization energy: Na, Mg, Al, Si, P.

Tutor Reference Answer:
Ionization energy generally increases across a period (left to right) due to increasing nuclear charge and decreasing atomic radius. The expected ranking is: Na < Mg < Al < Si < P. However, note that there is a slight dip at Al (compared to Mg) because aluminum loses a 3p electron (higher energy, easier to remove) while magnesium loses a 3s electron. Exam-level answer: Na < Al < Mg < Si < P.

Practice Problem A-3:
Which has the larger atomic radius: O or S? Explain.

Tutor Reference Answer:
Sulfur (S) has a larger atomic radius than oxygen (O). Both are in Group 16, but sulfur is one period lower, meaning it has an additional electron shell. Atomic radius increases down a group because each new shell is farther from the nucleus.

Practice Problem A-4:
Arrange the following in order of increasing electronegativity: C, N, O, F.

Tutor Reference Answer:
Electronegativity increases across a period: C < N < O < F. Fluorine is the most electronegative element on the periodic table with a value of 3.98 on the Pauling scale.

SECTION B: Chemical Nomenclature (Chapter 3)

Practice Problem B-1:
Name the following compounds:
(a) NaCl
(b) CaCO3
(c) Fe2O3
(d) H2SO4 (aqueous)
(e) N2O5

Tutor Reference Answer:
(a) Sodium chloride — ionic compound, name the cation (sodium) then the anion (chloride).
(b) Calcium carbonate — ionic compound with a polyatomic anion (carbonate, CO3^2-).
(c) Iron(III) oxide — transition metal compound, so Roman numeral is needed. Fe is +3 in this compound (since 2(+3) + 3(-2) = 0).
(d) Sulfuric acid — binary acids use hydro-...-ic; oxyacids with -ate anion become -ic acid. Sulfate (SO4^2-) is the -ate form, so the acid is sulfuric acid.
(e) Dinitrogen pentoxide — molecular compound between two nonmetals, use Greek prefixes.

Practice Problem B-2:
Write the chemical formula for each:
(a) Potassium permanganate
(b) Ammonium nitrate
(c) Phosphorus trichloride
(d) Copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate

Tutor Reference Answer:
(a) KMnO4 — potassium (K+) and permanganate (MnO4-).
(b) NH4NO3 — ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3-).
(c) PCl3 — molecular compound, prefixes indicate one phosphorus and three chlorine atoms.
(d) CuSO4 · 5H2O — copper(II) means Cu2+, sulfate is SO4^2-, pentahydrate means five water molecules.

SECTION C: Stoichiometry and Mole Conversions (Chapter 4)

Practice Problem C-1:
How many molecules are in 2.50 moles of CO2?

Tutor Reference Answer:
Number of molecules = moles × Avogadro's number = 2.50 mol × 6.022 × 10^23 molecules/mol = 1.506 × 10^24 molecules.

Practice Problem C-2:
What is the percent composition of carbon in ethanol (C2H5OH)?

Tutor Reference Answer:
Molar mass of C2H5OH = 2(12.01) + 6(1.008) + 16.00 = 46.07 g/mol.
Mass of carbon = 2(12.01) = 24.02 g/mol.
Percent carbon = (24.02 / 46.07) × 100% = 52.14%.

Practice Problem C-3:
Balance the following equation and determine the mole ratio of reactants to products:
___ C3H8 + ___ O2 → ___ CO2 + ___ H2O

Tutor Reference Answer:
C3H8 + 5O2 → 3CO2 + 4H2O.
Mole ratios: 1 mol C3H8 : 5 mol O2 : 3 mol CO2 : 4 mol H2O.

Practice Problem C-4:
A student reacts 12.0 g of magnesium with excess hydrochloric acid:
Mg + 2HCl → MgCl2 + H2

The student collects 0.380 g of hydrogen gas. What is the percent yield?

Tutor Reference Answer:
Moles of Mg = 12.0 / 24.31 = 0.4936 mol.
Theoretical moles of H2 = 0.4936 mol (1:1 ratio).
Theoretical mass of H2 = 0.4936 × 2.016 = 0.995 g.
Actual mass = 0.380 g.
Percent yield = (0.380 / 0.995) × 100% = 38.2%.

Practice Problem C-5:
If 4.00 g of NaOH is dissolved to make 250.0 mL of solution, what is the molarity?

Tutor Reference Answer:
Moles of NaOH = 4.00 / 40.00 = 0.100 mol.
Volume in liters = 250.0 mL × (1 L / 1000 mL) = 0.2500 L.
Molarity = 0.100 mol / 0.2500 L = 0.400 M.

SECTION D: Significant Figures — Additional Practice

Practice Problem D-1:
Determine the number of significant figures in each:
(a) 0.00100
(b) 40300
(c) 7.020 × 10^3
(d) 600.

Tutor Reference Answer:
(a) 0.00100 — 3 sig figs. Leading zeros are not significant; the trailing two zeros after the 1 are significant.
(b) 40300 — ambiguous without further context. Could be 3, 4, or 5 sig figs. Most textbooks treat this as 3 sig figs unless a decimal point is shown.
(c) 7.020 × 10^3 — 4 sig figs. Scientific notation makes all digits explicit.
(d) 600. — 3 sig figs. The trailing decimal point means all zeros are significant.

Practice Problem D-2:
Perform the following calculation and report the answer with the correct number of significant figures:
(3.42 × 10^2) × (1.7 × 10^-1) / (2.103)

Tutor Reference Answer:
3.42 × 10^2 = 342 (3 sig figs)
1.7 × 10^-1 = 0.17 (2 sig figs)
2.103 (4 sig figs)

342 × 0.17 = 58.14
58.14 / 2.103 = 27.6462...

Round to 2 sig figs (limited by 1.7): 28.

--- END OF TUTOR-GENERATED PRACTICE SET ---

--- ADDITIONAL SESSION NOTES ---

Student tnguyen_2027 is a freshman on the pre-med track taking CHEM 101 — General Chemistry I with Prof. Davidson. The Midterm Exam 1 is scheduled for 2025-09-12 and covers Chapters 1-4 of the Zumdahl & Zumdahl textbook (11th edition). The student referenced having scored 78% on the first homework set and noted that the exam is worth 20% of the course grade.

During this 47-minute session with 32 turns, the student worked through a total of 15 practice problems across three topic areas: empirical and molecular formulas, significant figures, and limiting reagents. The student correctly solved 7 of 10 practice problems during the interactive portion. The primary error patterns identified were in significant figures (counting leading zeros as significant) and unit conversion mechanics.

The student's study group with classmates rkhan_2027 and ldavis_2027 meets the following evening. The tutor recommended a two-day study plan: Day 1 focused on concept and formula review, Day 2 focused on practice problems and timed mock questions. The student was reminded that the periodic table will be provided on the exam but that formulas must be memorized (no formula sheet provided). An SI units conversion table was referenced as a study resource.

The session was bookmarked by the student for later review. The supplemental practice set above was generated during the session and saved to the student's review folder for offline study.
