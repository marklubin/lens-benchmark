[19:45:02] klee_2026: hey so i have my psych exam in 4 days and i need to go over research methods. i've been staring at chapter 1 for hours and nothing is sticking

[19:45:18] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Welcome back! Exam 1 for PSYC 200 is on 2025-09-22, so you have four full days to prepare. Before we jump into research methods, can you tell me what specific areas within that topic you find most challenging? That way we can focus our time where it'll help the most.

[19:45:35] klee_2026: ugh i have been reading the same chapter for 2 hours and i still cant tell you what a confounding variable is

[19:45:52] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: That's actually very common — and the fact that re-reading isn't working may be because it's a passive strategy. Let's try a different approach. I'll explain the three main variable types using a concrete experiment, and then I'll quiz you to see if the concept sticks better with active engagement.

There are three key variable types in experimental research:

1. **Independent Variable (IV):** The factor the researcher deliberately manipulates. It's what you change on purpose.
2. **Dependent Variable (DV):** The factor the researcher measures. It's the outcome you're interested in.
3. **Confounding Variable:** Any factor other than the IV that could affect the DV, potentially undermining the study's internal validity.

Here's an example experiment: A researcher wants to test whether drinking caffeine before an exam affects test performance. They give one group of students 200 mg of caffeine and another group a placebo, then measure their scores on a standardized math test.

- **IV:** Caffeine vs. placebo (what the researcher controls)
- **DV:** Math test scores (what gets measured)
- **Confounding variable:** If the caffeine group happened to study more, or if they took the test at a different time of day, those would be confounds — factors other than caffeine that could explain differences in scores.

Does that framing help?

[19:46:30] klee_2026: oh ok so its like the thing you DONT want affecting the results but it sneaks in anyway?

[19:46:44] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: That's a good way to think about it. A confounding variable is any factor other than the independent variable that could influence the dependent variable, potentially undermining the study's internal validity. The whole point of experimental design — random assignment, control groups, standardized procedures — is to minimize confounds so you can be more confident that any changes in the DV are actually due to the IV.

[19:47:02] klee_2026: ok i think i get it now. can you quiz me? like give me an experiment and i'll try to identify the variables

[19:47:16] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Great idea — active recall is much more effective than re-reading. Here's your first scenario:

**Scenario 1:** Researchers want to test whether room temperature affects math scores. They have one group of students take a math test in a room set to 68°F and another group take the same test in a room set to 85°F.

Identify the IV, DV, and suggest one possible confounding variable.

[19:47:38] klee_2026: ok so the IV is room temperature — thats what the researchers are changing between the two groups. the DV is math scores — thats what theyre measuring. and a possible confound would be... age? like if one group was older students and the other was younger, that could affect scores independently of the temperature

[19:47:58] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Excellent. You correctly identified the IV (room temperature — 68°F vs. 85°F), the DV (math scores), and you gave a valid confounding variable. Age of students could absolutely be a confound if it wasn't controlled for through random assignment. Other possible confounds might include time of day, math ability level, or even the specific test version used. But your answer demonstrates a solid understanding of what a confound is.

Let's try another one.

**Scenario 2:** A psychologist tests whether listening to classical music while studying improves memory retention. Group A studies vocabulary words in silence, and Group B studies the same words while listening to Mozart. Both groups are then tested on the vocabulary 24 hours later.

Identify the IV, DV, and a potential confound.

[19:48:28] klee_2026: IV is the study condition — silence vs. classical music. DV is memory retention, measured by the vocabulary test score 24 hours later. confound could be prior familiarity with the words? like if some students already knew some of the vocabulary

[19:48:45] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: That's three for three on the variable identification. And prior familiarity with the vocabulary words is a great example of a confound — it could boost some students' scores regardless of whether they listened to music.

One more scenario, and this one is a bit trickier:

**Scenario 3:** A study examines whether exercise frequency is related to depression symptoms. Participants are surveyed about how often they exercise per week and then complete a depression screening questionnaire.

Identify the variables and note: is this an experiment or a correlational study?

[19:49:10] klee_2026: hmm ok so exercise frequency would be... the IV? and depression symptoms the DV? but wait — the researchers arent actually assigning anyone to exercise or not exercise. theyre just measuring what people already do. so this is correlational, not experimental

[19:49:28] klee_2026: so i guess technically theres no IV and DV in the strict experimental sense. the two variables being measured are exercise frequency and depression symptoms

[19:49:42] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: That's an excellent answer, and you caught the key distinction. In a correlational study, there is no manipulation — the researcher is observing naturally occurring variation. So we refer to the measured variables rather than independent and dependent variables. Some textbooks, including Myers' Psychology (13th edition), will still use IV/DV language loosely for correlational studies, but strictly speaking, you can only establish cause-and-effect relationships in true experiments with random assignment and manipulation.

You nailed all three scenarios. Let's shift topics. What else is on the exam?

[19:50:05] klee_2026: the exam covers five chapters: research methods, neuroscience, sensation and perception, consciousness, and development. can we do neuroscience next? i have notes from prof osei's review session earlier today but i still mix up some of the brain stuff

[19:50:22] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Of course. Neuroscience is a big chapter — let's focus on the areas that tend to show up most on Intro Psych exams. What do you want to start with?

[19:50:36] klee_2026: whats the difference between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system? i know theyre both part of the autonomic nervous system but i mix up which one does what

[19:50:52] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: This is one of the most commonly tested distinctions in the neuroscience chapter. The autonomic nervous system has two branches:

**Sympathetic Nervous System:**
- Often described with the phrase "fight or flight"
- Activates during stress, danger, or excitement
- Increases heart rate, dilates pupils, inhibits digestion, releases adrenaline
- Prepares your body for action

**Parasympathetic Nervous System:**
- Often described with the phrase "rest and digest"
- Activates during calm, relaxed states
- Decreases heart rate, constricts pupils, stimulates digestion, conserves energy
- Returns your body to its baseline state after the sympathetic system has activated

The two systems work in opposition — when one is more active, the other is less active. Think of them as a gas pedal (sympathetic) and a brake pedal (parasympathetic).

[19:51:25] klee_2026: ok fight or flight vs rest and digest. i can remember that. what about the brain lobes? is there like a mnemonic to remember which lobe does what?

[19:51:40] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Here's one that many students find helpful:

**Frontal** for **future planning** — executive function, decision-making, personality, voluntary motor control, speech production (Broca's area is here)

**Parietal** for **positioning** — somatosensory processing (touch, pressure, temperature, pain), spatial awareness, body position

**Temporal** for **tunes and talk** — auditory processing, language comprehension (Wernicke's area is here), memory formation (hippocampus is nearby)

**Occipital** for **optical** — visual processing, located at the very back of the brain

The first letter of each function roughly matches the lobe: Frontal/Future, Parietal/Positioning, Temporal/Tunes, Occipital/Optical.

[19:52:08] klee_2026: oh thats perfect. frontal future parietal positioning temporal tunes occipital optical. ok speaking of broca and wernicke — i ALWAYS mix those up on practice quizzes

[19:52:24] klee_2026: wait so broca is the one that starts with B for 'broken speech'? like they cant get words out?

[19:52:38] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: That's actually a very effective mnemonic. Broca's aphasia does indeed result in broken, effortful speech while comprehension remains relatively intact. Let me lay out both:

**Broca's Area:**
- Located in the **frontal** lobe (left hemisphere, typically)
- Responsible for speech **production**
- Damage causes **Broca's aphasia**: speech is slow, labored, and telegraphic. The person knows what they want to say but struggles to get the words out. Comprehension is mostly intact.
- Mnemonic: **B**roca's = **B**roken speech

**Wernicke's Area:**
- Located in the **temporal** lobe (left hemisphere, typically)
- Responsible for language **comprehension**
- Damage causes **Wernicke's aphasia**: speech is fluent but nonsensical. The person produces grammatically correct sentences that don't make sense. They also have difficulty understanding others' speech.
- Mnemonic: **W**ernicke's = **W**ordy but wrong

So a person with Broca's aphasia might say: "Walk... dog... park" (broken, but meaningful). A person with Wernicke's aphasia might say: "I went to the the hamster and the blue ones are all flying with the seven" (fluent, but nonsensical).

[19:53:15] klee_2026: ok broca broken wernicke wordy. got it. i feel like the mnemonics make it so much easier than just trying to memorize definitions

[19:53:30] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Mnemonics are a form of elaborative encoding — you're connecting new information to meaningful associations, which creates stronger memory traces than rote repetition. That's actually one of the study strategies we'll get to if we discuss consciousness and memory. Ready to move to sensation and perception, or do you want to cover more neuroscience?

[19:53:48] klee_2026: lets do sensation vs perception. prof osei said that distinction will definitely be on the exam

[19:54:02] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: That's a foundational distinction in Chapter 4.

**Sensation** is the process by which your sensory organs (eyes, ears, skin, nose, tongue) detect raw physical stimuli from the environment and convert them into neural signals. It's the "raw data" input stage — light hitting your retina, sound waves reaching your cochlea, pressure on your skin.

**Perception** is the process by which your brain organizes and interprets those sensory signals to create a meaningful experience. It's the "making sense of the data" stage — recognizing that the pattern of light is your friend's face, that the sound waves form a melody, that the pressure on your skin is a handshake.

The classic way to distinguish them: sensation asks "what physical energy is being received?" while perception asks "what does the brain make of it?"

[19:54:35] klee_2026: ok that makes sense. what about top-down vs bottom-up processing? those came up in the review slides posted on canvas

[19:54:50] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Great question — this is closely related to the sensation/perception distinction.

**Bottom-up processing** starts with the sensory input and builds up to the brain's interpretation. You start with the raw data and construct understanding from the ground up. This is what happens when you encounter something completely new and unfamiliar.

Example: You hear an unfamiliar noise in the forest. You have no expectations or context, so your brain must analyze the raw sound properties (pitch, loudness, duration) to figure out what it is.

**Top-down processing** starts with the brain's existing knowledge, expectations, or context and uses that to interpret the sensory input. Your prior experience shapes what you perceive, sometimes before the sensory data is fully processed.

Example: You can read a sentence with misspelled words relatively easily: "Yuo cna raed tihs bcuase yuor barin flils in teh gpes." Your brain's knowledge of English and expectations about word shapes lets you perceive the meaning despite the garbled input.

Another way to remember: **Bottom-up = data-driven**, **Top-down = concept-driven**.

[19:55:28] klee_2026: oh ok so like when you look at an ambiguous image and what you see depends on what you expect to see, thats top-down?

[19:55:42] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Exactly. The classic example is the Rubin's vase — the image that can be seen as either a vase or two faces in profile. What you perceive first is often influenced by the context you've been primed with. If you were just looking at pictures of faces, you're more likely to see the faces first. That's top-down processing shaping your perception of the same sensory input.

[19:55:58] klee_2026: ok this is good. can we talk about study strategies for a sec? like what's the best way to prepare for multiple choice exams in psych?

[19:56:12] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: This is actually directly relevant to what you'll learn in the consciousness and memory chapters. The research on study strategies for multiple-choice exams is very clear:

1. **Active recall over re-reading.** Testing yourself on the material is far more effective than passively reviewing it. This means using flashcards, practice quizzes, or having someone quiz you — anything that forces you to retrieve information from memory rather than just recognizing it on the page.

2. **Spaced practice.** Distribute your studying over multiple shorter sessions rather than one long cramming session. Studying for 1 hour across 4 different days is more effective than 4 hours in one sitting.

3. **Elaborative interrogation.** For each concept, ask yourself "why is this true?" or "how does this connect to other things I know?" This forces deeper processing than surface-level reading.

The reason re-reading feels like it works is that it creates a sense of familiarity — you recognize the text and feel like you know it. But recognition is much easier than recall, and exams require recall.

[19:56:50] klee_2026: ok real talk — is re-reading my highlights actually helping or am i wasting time

[19:57:05] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Research on study strategies consistently shows that passive re-reading is one of the least effective methods for long-term retention. You'd benefit more from self-testing and spaced retrieval practice. The problem with highlighting and re-reading is twofold:

First, highlighting tends to be indiscriminate — students often highlight too much, which means they're not making decisions about what's important (a process that itself aids memory).

Second, re-reading creates an illusion of familiarity without deep encoding. When you re-read a passage and think "yes, I know this," what you're actually experiencing is recognition fluency — the text feels familiar because you've seen it recently, not because you've encoded it deeply enough to recall it on demand.

A more effective approach: close your textbook, write down everything you can remember about a topic, then open the book and check what you missed. That gap between what you wrote and what was in the book is exactly what you need to study.

[19:57:38] klee_2026: lol ok im throwing my highlighters away. can you quiz me on the neuroscience stuff?

[19:57:52] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Let's do it. I'll ask questions in a style similar to what you might see on a 60-question multiple-choice exam.

**Question 1:** A patient has damage to their temporal lobe and can produce fluent speech but the sentences don't make sense. They also have difficulty understanding what others say to them. This is most consistent with damage to which brain area?

(A) Broca's area
(B) Wernicke's area
(C) The motor cortex
(D) The occipital lobe

[19:58:10] klee_2026: B — Wernicke's area. Fluent but nonsensical speech plus trouble understanding language. Wernicke is wordy but wrong

[19:58:22] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Correct. The key giveaways were: fluent speech (rules out Broca's, which produces broken speech), nonsensical content, and impaired comprehension. Your mnemonic is serving you well.

**Question 2:** Which division of the autonomic nervous system would be most active during a job interview?

(A) Somatic nervous system
(B) Parasympathetic nervous system
(C) Sympathetic nervous system
(D) Central nervous system

[19:58:42] klee_2026: C — sympathetic. A job interview is stressful so fight or flight would kick in. Increased heart rate, sweating, etc.

[19:58:55] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Correct again. The sympathetic nervous system activates during stress and arousal, even in non-dangerous situations like interviews, public speaking, or exam-taking. The physiological symptoms — increased heart rate, sweating, dry mouth — are all sympathetic responses.

**Question 3:** A researcher finds that people who exercise more frequently report fewer symptoms of depression. From this study alone, which conclusion is most appropriate?

(A) Exercise reduces depression
(B) Depression causes people to exercise less
(C) There is a correlation between exercise and depression symptoms
(D) A confounding variable must be present

[19:59:18] klee_2026: C — its correlational so we can only say theres a correlation, not causation. We cant tell the direction or whether a third variable is involved

[19:59:32] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Exactly right, and your reasoning is excellent. A correlational study can establish that two variables are related but cannot determine causation. Options A and B both imply a causal direction, which cannot be established from correlational data alone. Option D is too strong — there may or may not be a confound, but the study design prevents ruling one out.

**Question 4:** Which of the following best demonstrates top-down processing?

(A) Detecting a faint sound in a quiet room
(B) Reading a sentence with several misspelled words and still understanding it
(C) Feeling pain when you touch a hot stove
(D) Noticing a bright flash of light

[19:59:52] klee_2026: B — reading misspelled words uses your prior knowledge of the language to fill in what the words should be. Thats top-down because you're using what you already know to interpret the input

[20:00:06] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Perfect. Options A, C, and D are all examples of bottom-up processing — they start with the sensory stimulus and work upward. Reading misspelled words is the classic top-down example because your brain's existing knowledge of English spelling and word shapes guides perception even when the raw sensory input (the letters on the page) doesn't match normal patterns.

**Question 5:** The parietal lobe is primarily responsible for processing which type of information?

(A) Visual information
(B) Auditory information
(C) Somatosensory information (touch, pain, temperature)
(D) Olfactory information (smell)

[20:00:28] klee_2026: C — parietal for positioning! Touch, pressure, temperature, pain, spatial awareness

[20:00:40] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Correct. Parietal lobe processes somatosensory information and spatial awareness. Visual information (A) is occipital. Auditory (B) is temporal. Olfactory (D) involves the olfactory cortex and limbic structures.

You went 5 for 5 on those quiz questions. That's a strong performance, especially since three of those questions combined material from different sections of the chapter.

[20:00:58] klee_2026: nice!! ok i feel a lot better about this than i did an hour ago. i think im gonna go use the practice quiz feature on the textbook's companion website for Myers' 13th edition. that should give me more questions in this format

[20:01:12] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: That's an excellent plan. The companion website practice quizzes will give you experience with the exact format you'll encounter on the exam — 60 multiple-choice questions in 75 minutes. A few tips for using the practice quizzes effectively:

1. **Simulate exam conditions.** Time yourself and don't look up answers while taking the quiz.
2. **Review every wrong answer.** Don't just check your score — go back and understand why the correct answer is correct and why your answer was wrong.
3. **Take the quiz more than once**, but space the attempts out. Don't retake it immediately.

You mentioned attending Prof. Osei's review session earlier today and taking notes — those notes combined with the practice quizzes should give you good coverage.

[20:01:42] klee_2026: yeah prof osei's review was helpful but it went really fast. like 50 slides in an hour. thats why im here trying to actually absorb the details lol

[20:01:55] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Review sessions tend to be broad overviews rather than deep dives — they're more useful for identifying which topics will be emphasized than for actually learning the material. The fact that you're supplementing with active practice is exactly the right approach.

Let me also mention that teaching assistant Marcus may have additional study resources or practice exams available. TA-created materials often closely match the exam style since TAs help grade the exams and understand what the instructor values.

[20:02:12] klee_2026: oh thats a good point. i'll email marcus. ok one more thing — you mentioned elaborative interrogation earlier. can you give me an example of how to use that for the neuroscience chapter?

[20:02:28] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Sure. Elaborative interrogation means asking "why" or "how" questions about the facts you're learning. Here are examples:

**Fact:** The sympathetic nervous system dilates the pupils.
**Elaborative question:** Why would dilated pupils be useful in a fight-or-flight situation?
**Answer you construct:** Dilated pupils let in more light, which means better vision in potentially dangerous situations. This would help you see threats more clearly.

**Fact:** Broca's area is located in the frontal lobe.
**Elaborative question:** Why does it make sense that speech production is in the frontal lobe?
**Answer you construct:** The frontal lobe handles planning and motor control. Speaking requires planning what to say and coordinating the motor movements of the mouth, tongue, and vocal cords.

**Fact:** Wernicke's area is in the temporal lobe.
**Elaborative question:** Why does it make sense that language comprehension is in the temporal lobe?
**Answer you construct:** The temporal lobe processes auditory information. Comprehending spoken language requires processing the sounds of speech, so it makes sense that the comprehension area is near the auditory processing area.

See how each question forces you to create a meaningful connection? That's what builds durable memory traces.

[20:03:05] klee_2026: oh wow thats actually really helpful. its like building a story around each fact instead of just memorizing it in isolation

[20:03:18] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: That's a great way to describe it. Memory research (which you'll study in more depth in the coming chapters) shows that information connected to existing knowledge through meaningful elaboration is far more resistant to forgetting than isolated facts.

[20:03:32] klee_2026: ok im going to try the elaborative interrogation thing tonight for the consciousness and development chapters. those are the ones i havent studied at all yet

[20:03:45] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Here's a quick overview of what you'll want to focus on for those chapters:

**Consciousness (Chapter on consciousness):**
- Stages of sleep (NREM stages 1-3, REM) and their characteristics
- Sleep disorders (insomnia, narcolepsy, sleep apnea)
- Theories of dreaming (Freud's wish-fulfillment, information processing, activation-synthesis)
- Hypnosis: what it can and can't do
- Effects of psychoactive drugs (depressants, stimulants, hallucinogens)

**Development (Chapter on development):**
- Piaget's stages of cognitive development (sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, formal operational)
- Erikson's psychosocial stages
- Attachment theory (Ainsworth's Strange Situation, secure vs. insecure attachment)
- Nature vs. nurture themes
- Prenatal development and teratogens

For each of these topics, try the elaborative interrogation approach: state the fact, ask yourself "why" or "how," and construct an explanation.

[20:04:15] klee_2026: perfect. ok im logging off to study. i have a 3.4 GPA and im aiming for an A in this course so i really need to do well on this exam

[20:04:28] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: With a 3.4 GPA, you clearly have strong study habits overall — the key for this exam is shifting from passive review to active retrieval. Here's your action plan for the next four days:

**Tonight (Day 1):** Consciousness and development chapters using elaborative interrogation. Focus on understanding, not memorizing.

**Tomorrow (Day 2):** Practice quizzes on the Myers' companion website. Review wrong answers thoroughly.

**Day 3:** Return to the topics from tonight's session — neuroscience, sensation/perception, research methods — and self-test using the quiz approach we used here.

**Day 4 (Exam day, Monday):** Quick review of your notes and mnemonics. Don't try to learn anything new.

You've got this. Your performance on the quiz questions tonight was flawless — 5 for 5, with clear reasoning on each answer.

[20:04:50] klee_2026: thanks!! this was way more helpful than staring at my textbook for another 2 hours. bye!

[20:05:00] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Good luck on the exam! Remember — if you can explain it, you understand it. Use that as your test.

SUPPLEMENTAL TRANSCRIPT CONTINUATION — EXTENDED STUDY MATERIALS

The following content was generated during the session as supplemental review material for the student's exam preparation. It covers the five chapters within the PSYC 200 Exam 1 scope.

--- TUTOR-GENERATED REVIEW GUIDE: PSYC 200 EXAM 1 ---

CHAPTER 1: RESEARCH METHODS — KEY CONCEPTS

1. The Scientific Method in Psychology
Psychology as a science follows the same empirical approach as the natural sciences: observation, hypothesis formation, data collection, analysis, and conclusion. The key distinction between scientific psychology and common sense is that scientific psychology relies on systematic observation and measurement rather than intuition or anecdotal experience.

2. Types of Research
- **Descriptive methods:** Case studies (in-depth study of one individual), surveys (questionnaires administered to a sample), naturalistic observation (observing behavior in natural settings without intervention). These methods describe behavior but cannot establish causation.
- **Correlational studies:** Measure the relationship between two variables. Correlation coefficient ranges from -1.00 to +1.00. A positive correlation means both variables move in the same direction; a negative correlation means they move in opposite directions. The strength of the relationship is determined by the absolute value. A correlation of -0.85 is stronger than a correlation of +0.40.
- **Experiments:** The only method that can establish cause-and-effect relationships. Requires manipulation of an independent variable, measurement of a dependent variable, random assignment of participants, and control of confounding variables.

3. Key Terms
- **Random assignment:** Every participant has an equal chance of being placed in any condition. This helps distribute individual differences evenly across groups.
- **Random sampling:** Every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected for the study. This aids generalizability.
- **Double-blind procedure:** Neither the participants nor the researchers interacting with them know who is in the experimental vs. control group. This prevents demand characteristics and experimenter bias.
- **Placebo effect:** Participants improve simply because they believe they are receiving treatment.
- **Statistical significance:** A result is statistically significant when the probability of it occurring by chance is very low (typically less than 5%, or p < .05).

4. Ethics in Research
- Informed consent, debriefing, confidentiality, and the right to withdraw.
- Animal research must follow guidelines balancing scientific value with animal welfare.
- Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) approve research involving human participants.

CHAPTER 2: NEUROSCIENCE — KEY CONCEPTS

1. Neurons
- Structure: dendrites (receive signals), cell body (soma, contains nucleus), axon (transmits signals), myelin sheath (insulates axon, speeds transmission), terminal buttons (release neurotransmitters).
- Action potential: an all-or-nothing electrical impulse that travels down the axon. Resting potential is approximately -70mV. When a neuron is stimulated above the threshold, sodium ions rush in (depolarization), then potassium ions rush out (repolarization).
- Synapse: the gap between neurons. Neurotransmitters are released from the presynaptic neuron, cross the synaptic cleft, and bind to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron.

2. Key Neurotransmitters
- **Acetylcholine (ACh):** Muscle contraction, memory, learning. Degeneration of ACh-producing neurons is associated with Alzheimer's disease.
- **Dopamine:** Movement, pleasure, motivation. Excess dopamine activity is associated with schizophrenia; deficiency is associated with Parkinson's disease.
- **Serotonin:** Mood regulation, sleep, appetite. Low serotonin is associated with depression. SSRIs block reuptake of serotonin.
- **GABA:** The primary inhibitory neurotransmitter. Low GABA activity is associated with anxiety disorders.
- **Norepinephrine:** Alertness, arousal, fight-or-flight response.
- **Endorphins:** Natural painkillers. Released during exercise, stress, and injury.

3. The Nervous System
- **Central Nervous System (CNS):** Brain and spinal cord.
- **Peripheral Nervous System (PNS):** Somatic (voluntary muscle control) and Autonomic (involuntary functions).
  - Sympathetic: Fight-or-flight (arousal, energy mobilization).
  - Parasympathetic: Rest-and-digest (calming, energy conservation).

4. Brain Structure
- **Brainstem:** Medulla (heart rate, breathing), pons (sleep, coordination), reticular formation (alertness/arousal).
- **Cerebellum:** Coordination of voluntary movement, balance, motor learning.
- **Limbic System:** Amygdala (emotion, especially fear), hippocampus (memory formation), hypothalamus (hunger, thirst, body temperature, circadian rhythms).
- **Cerebral Cortex:**
  - Frontal lobe: Planning, decision-making, personality, motor control, Broca's area (speech production).
  - Parietal lobe: Somatosensory processing, spatial awareness.
  - Temporal lobe: Auditory processing, Wernicke's area (language comprehension).
  - Occipital lobe: Visual processing.

5. Brain Plasticity
The brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections. More pronounced in younger brains but continues throughout life. Neurogenesis (birth of new neurons) occurs in the hippocampus.

CHAPTER 3: SENSATION AND PERCEPTION — KEY CONCEPTS

1. Sensation vs. Perception
- Sensation: Detection of physical stimuli by sensory organs and conversion to neural signals (transduction).
- Perception: Brain's interpretation and organization of sensory information.

2. Thresholds
- Absolute threshold: Minimum stimulation needed to detect a stimulus 50% of the time.
- Difference threshold (just noticeable difference, JND): Minimum change in stimulation needed to detect a difference. Weber's Law: the JND is a constant proportion of the original stimulus.
- Signal detection theory: Detection of a stimulus depends not only on signal strength but also on the observer's experience, expectations, motivation, and alertness.

3. Vision
- Light enters through the cornea, passes through the pupil (aperture controlled by the iris), focused by the lens onto the retina.
- Retina contains rods (peripheral vision, dim light, black-and-white) and cones (central vision, color, detail).
- Trichromatic theory: Three types of cones (red, green, blue) combine to produce color vision. Explains color mixing.
- Opponent-process theory: Color vision depends on three pairs of opponent colors (red/green, blue/yellow, black/white). Explains afterimages.

4. Hearing
- Sound waves enter the ear canal, vibrate the eardrum (tympanic membrane), transmitted through ossicles (hammer, anvil, stirrup) to the cochlea.
- Place theory: Different pitches activate different locations on the basilar membrane. Works well for high-frequency sounds.
- Frequency theory: The rate of neural impulses matches the frequency of the sound wave. Works well for low-frequency sounds.

5. Processing
- Bottom-up processing: Data-driven, starts with sensory receptors, builds upward.
- Top-down processing: Concept-driven, starts with existing knowledge and expectations.
- Gestalt principles: Proximity, similarity, continuity, closure, figure-ground.

CHAPTER 4: CONSCIOUSNESS — KEY CONCEPTS

1. States of Consciousness
- Waking consciousness, sleep, dreams, hypnosis, meditation, drug-altered states.
- Circadian rhythm: 24-hour biological clock, regulated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the hypothalamus.

2. Sleep Stages
- NREM Stage 1: Light sleep, hypnagogic sensations, easy to wake.
- NREM Stage 2: Sleep spindles and K-complexes, body temperature drops.
- NREM Stage 3 (slow-wave sleep): Deep sleep, delta waves, hardest to wake, important for physical restoration and memory consolidation.
- REM sleep: Rapid eye movement, vivid dreams, muscle paralysis (atonia), brain activity resembles waking. Important for emotional processing and learning.

3. Sleep Disorders
- Insomnia: Difficulty falling or staying asleep.
- Narcolepsy: Sudden, uncontrollable episodes of falling asleep.
- Sleep apnea: Breathing interruptions during sleep.
- Sleepwalking and sleep talking: Occur during NREM Stage 3.

4. Dreams
- Freud's theory: Dreams are wish fulfillment; manifest content (storyline) disguises latent content (unconscious wishes).
- Information-processing theory: Dreams help consolidate memories and process information from the day.
- Activation-synthesis theory: Dreams result from the brain's attempt to make sense of random neural activity during REM sleep.

5. Psychoactive Drugs
- Depressants (alcohol, barbiturates, opiates): Slow neural activity, reduce anxiety, impair judgment.
- Stimulants (caffeine, nicotine, cocaine, amphetamines): Speed up neural activity, increase alertness and energy.
- Hallucinogens (LSD, psilocybin, marijuana): Distort perceptions and cognitions.
- Tolerance: Need for larger doses to achieve the same effect.
- Withdrawal: Discomfort when discontinuing drug use.

CHAPTER 5: DEVELOPMENT — KEY CONCEPTS

1. Prenatal Development
- Germinal stage (0-2 weeks), embryonic stage (2-8 weeks), fetal stage (8 weeks to birth).
- Teratogens: Harmful substances that can cross the placental barrier (alcohol, drugs, certain viruses). Fetal alcohol syndrome is a leading preventable cause of intellectual disability.

2. Piaget's Stages of Cognitive Development
- Sensorimotor (0-2 years): Object permanence, learning through senses and motor actions.
- Preoperational (2-7 years): Symbolic thinking, egocentrism, lack of conservation.
- Concrete operational (7-11 years): Logical thinking about concrete objects, conservation, classification.
- Formal operational (12+ years): Abstract reasoning, hypothetical thinking.

3. Erikson's Psychosocial Stages
- Trust vs. Mistrust (infancy)
- Autonomy vs. Shame/Doubt (toddlerhood)
- Initiative vs. Guilt (preschool)
- Industry vs. Inferiority (elementary school)
- Identity vs. Role Confusion (adolescence)
- Intimacy vs. Isolation (young adulthood)
- Generativity vs. Stagnation (middle adulthood)
- Integrity vs. Despair (late adulthood)

4. Attachment
- Ainsworth's Strange Situation: Observes infant behavior when caregiver leaves and returns.
  - Secure attachment: Distressed when caregiver leaves, comforted upon return.
  - Insecure-avoidant: Not distressed when caregiver leaves, avoids upon return.
  - Insecure-anxious/ambivalent: Very distressed when caregiver leaves, not easily comforted upon return.
  - Disorganized: Inconsistent, confused behavior.

5. Nature vs. Nurture
- The interaction between genetic predispositions and environmental influences. Modern psychology recognizes that behavior is almost always the product of both.
- Twin studies and adoption studies help disentangle genetic and environmental contributions.

--- SESSION ANALYTICS ---

Student klee_2026 is a sophomore psychology major with a 3.4 GPA, currently enrolled in PSYC 200 — Introductory Psychology with Prof. Amara Osei. Exam 1 is scheduled for 2025-09-22 and covers five chapters: research methods, neuroscience, sensation/perception, consciousness, and development. The exam format is 60 multiple-choice questions in 75 minutes, based on Myers' Psychology textbook (13th edition).

During this 38-minute session with 28 turns, the student initially reported difficulty with research methods despite two hours of textbook re-reading. The session shifted from passive review to active recall, with the student correctly identifying variables in 3 of 3 experiment scenarios and answering 5 of 5 multiple-choice questions correctly.

The student initially confused Broca's and Wernicke's areas but successfully learned the distinction using the "Broca's = Broken speech" and "Wernicke's = Wordy but wrong" mnemonic framework. The tutor provided the lobe mnemonic "Frontal for future planning, Parietal for positioning, Temporal for tunes and talk, Occipital for optical."

The student was advised to shift from passive re-reading and highlighting to active recall, spaced practice, and elaborative interrogation. The student planned to use the practice quiz feature on the textbook's companion website and to email teaching assistant Marcus for additional resources. Review session slides from Prof. Osei's earlier review were posted on Canvas.
