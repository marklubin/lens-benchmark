[10:30:45] StudyBuddy AI Tutor:
Hi Jiwon! Thanks for sharing the assignment details from Prof. Torres. That's a great assignment — using AI-assisted brainstorming for a cell biology term paper is a solid approach to building a strong outline.

Let me make sure I understand the key requirements:
- 12-15 page term paper on a cell signaling pathway of your choice
- At least 7 major sections with 2-4 subsections each
- Minimum 15 peer-reviewed sources (8 in the preliminary bibliography)
- Due November 14, with the outline due October 3

So we have about a week and a half to get this outline in shape. Have you already picked which cell signaling pathway you want to focus on, or would you like to brainstorm some options first?

[10:31:22] jpark_2025:
yeah i already know i want to do JAK-STAT

[10:31:35] StudyBuddy AI Tutor:
Great choice! The JAK-STAT (Janus Kinase — Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription) pathway is a rich topic with a lot of depth to explore. It's central to cytokine signaling, immune regulation, hematopoiesis, and has major clinical relevance through JAK inhibitors.

Before we start building the outline, it would help to know what aspects of JAK-STAT you want to focus on. There are a few different angles you could take:

1. **Molecular mechanisms** — a deep dive into the biochemistry of JAK activation, STAT dimerization, nuclear translocation, and transcriptional regulation
2. **Immunological focus** — how JAK-STAT mediates interferon and interleukin signaling in innate and adaptive immunity
3. **Disease and therapeutics** — JAK-STAT dysregulation in cancer, autoimmune disorders, and the development of JAK inhibitors (e.g., tofacitinib, ruxolitinib)
4. **Regulatory mechanisms** — SOCS proteins, PTPs, PIAS family, and how the pathway is fine-tuned
5. **Evolutionary perspective** — conservation of JAK-STAT across metazoans, from Drosophila to mammals

Or you could combine a few of these. What sounds most interesting to you?

[10:32:18] jpark_2025:
hmm idk probably a mix of 1 and 3? like the molecular stuff but also how it connects to disease

[10:32:42] StudyBuddy AI Tutor:
That's a solid combination. You can structure the paper so the first half builds the molecular foundation — how JAK-STAT works at the biochemical level — and the second half applies that knowledge to disease contexts and therapeutic interventions. That way you satisfy the depth-of-coverage criterion while also making the paper clinically relevant, which tends to make for a more engaging read.

Let me ask a couple more scoping questions:

- Do you want to cover all four JAK family members (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, TYK2) or focus on a specific subset?
- For the disease angle, are you thinking broadly (cancer + autoimmune + myeloproliferative disorders) or do you want to focus on one disease category?
- Prof. Torres mentioned primary literature — have you already read any key papers on JAK-STAT that you want to build around?

[10:33:30] jpark_2025:
umm probably all four JAKs briefly but focus on jak2 since thats the one with the v617f mutation right? and for disease im thinking myeloproliferative neoplasms mostly. and no i havent really read papers yet lol

[10:33:55] StudyBuddy AI Tutor:
Good thinking on JAK2 V617F — that's one of the most well-characterized gain-of-function mutations in the pathway and a great anchor for the disease section. Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) like polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis are well-documented JAK2-driven diseases.

That gives us a clear narrative arc for the paper: start from the molecular machinery, zoom into JAK2 specifically, then pivot to what happens when it goes wrong and how we target it therapeutically.

Let me put together a detailed outline for you based on what we've discussed. I'll aim for the 7-section minimum with subsections.

[10:34:10] jpark_2025:
just generate an outline for me, the assignment says to use you for brainstorming

[10:34:32] StudyBuddy AI Tutor:
Absolutely — here's a comprehensive outline for your BIOL 301 term paper on the JAK-STAT pathway with a focus on JAK2 and myeloproliferative neoplasms:

---

That gives you 8 major sections (including intro and conclusion), each with 2-4 subsections. It should satisfy the structural requirements from Prof. Torres while giving you a natural flow from basic science to clinical application.

Want me to adjust any sections, add more subsections, or shift the emphasis?

[10:36:45] jpark_2025:
wow thats really thorough. no that looks good actually. umm one thing tho

[10:36:58] jpark_2025:
can you also show me what the introduction might look like? like, what a strong student would write for this

[10:37:25] StudyBuddy AI Tutor:
I can give you a brief example of how an introduction might open to give you a sense of the tone and structure, but I want to note that the assignment from Prof. Torres asks for an outline, not a draft. The introduction is something you'll want to write yourself when you start on the paper — that's where the 30% depth-of-coverage grade really comes from.

That said, here's a short example of how you might open the paper (~60 words):

*"Cell signaling pathways orchestrate the molecular conversations that govern cellular behavior. Among these, the JAK-STAT pathway stands as a central mediator of cytokine-driven signal transduction, translating extracellular cues into transcriptional responses. First characterized in the early 1990s through studies of interferon signaling, this pathway has since emerged as a critical node in hematopoiesis, immune regulation, and oncogenesis."*

That gives you a sense of the register and how to set up the topic. For your own introduction, you'd want to:
- Establish the broader context (cell signaling)
- Narrow to JAK-STAT specifically
- State why it matters (clinical relevance)
- Preview your paper's scope and argument

Would you like some tips on writing the rest of the introduction yourself?

[10:38:42] jpark_2025:
yeah but itd help to see what good writing looks like for this topic

[10:39:05] StudyBuddy AI Tutor:
I understand wanting to see strong writing models! Rather than writing more of the paper for you, let me share some specific writing tips that apply to cell biology papers like this one:

**1. Lead with significance, not history.**
Instead of "The JAK-STAT pathway was discovered in 1992," try opening with why the pathway matters today, then layer in historical context. Reviewers (and Prof. Torres) respond better to papers that establish relevance up front.

**2. Use precise language for molecular events.**
In cell biology, vague verbs weaken your writing. Instead of "JAK2 affects the receptor," say "JAK2 transphosphorylates tyrosine residues on the intracellular domain of the receptor." Specificity shows mastery.

**3. Connect mechanism to phenotype.**
When you describe the V617F mutation, don't just say it "causes" MPNs. Walk through the structural change (valine → phenylalanine in the JH2 pseudokinase domain), explain how it disrupts autoinhibition, and then connect that to constitutive signaling and clonal expansion. That causal chain is what a strong paper does.

**4. Use transitions between sections.**
Your outline moves from molecular architecture to signal transduction to regulation. Make those transitions explicit: "Having established the structural components of the pathway, we now trace the sequence of molecular events that constitute signal transduction."

**5. Cite strategically.**
Don't dump all your citations in one paragraph. Distribute them across claims. For a review paper like this, aim for 1-3 citations per major claim.

**6. End the introduction with a roadmap.**
A sentence like "This paper first examines the molecular architecture of JAK-STAT signaling, then focuses on the JAK2 V617F mutation and its role in myeloproliferative neoplasms, and concludes with current and emerging therapeutic strategies" helps orient the reader.

Would any of these be helpful to dig into further? Or would you like to talk about the bibliography?

[10:40:30] jpark_2025:
those are good tips thanks. yeah actually can you help with the bibliography? what are the key papers i should cite on JAK-STAT?

[10:40:55] StudyBuddy AI Tutor:
Sure! Here are some foundational and widely-cited reviews and primary papers on the JAK-STAT pathway that would be excellent starting points for your bibliography. I'll organize them by the sections of your outline:

**Foundational / Historical:**
- Darnell JE Jr, Kerr IM, Stark GR. "Jak-STAT pathways and transcriptional activation in response to IFNs and other extracellular signaling proteins." *Science*. 1994;264(5164):1415-1421.
   - This is the landmark paper that established the framework. Practically required for any JAK-STAT paper.

- Shuai K, Schindler C, Bhatt VR, et al. "Activation of transcription by IFN-gamma: tyrosine phosphorylation of a 91-kD DNA binding protein." *Science*. 1992;258(5089):1808-1812.
   - One of the original papers identifying STAT activation.

**Molecular Mechanism / Structure:**
- O'Shea JJ, Schwartz DM, Villarino AV, et al. "The JAK-STAT pathway: impact on human disease and therapeutic intervention." *Annual Review of Medicine*. 2015;66:311-328.
   - Excellent comprehensive review covering mechanism and clinical relevance.

- Villarino AV, Kanno Y, O'Shea JJ. "Mechanisms and consequences of Jak-STAT signaling in the immune system." *Nature Immunology*. 2017;18(4):374-384.
   - Focuses on immunological context but covers core mechanism well.

**JAK2 and V617F:**
- Baxter EJ, Scott LM, Campbell PJ, et al. "Acquired mutation of the tyrosine kinase JAK2 in human myeloproliferative disorders." *The Lancet*. 2005;365(9464):1054-1061.
   - One of the original papers reporting JAK2 V617F.

- Levine RL, Wadleigh M, Sternberg DW, et al. "Activating mutation in the tyrosine kinase JAK2 in polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and myeloid metaplasia with myelofibrosis." *Cancer Cell*. 2005;7(4):387-397.
   - Another foundational V617F paper, independently reported.

**Myeloproliferative Neoplasms:**
- Tefferi A, Pardanani A. "Myeloproliferative neoplasms: a contemporary review." *JAMA Oncology*. 2015;1(1):97-105.
   - Solid clinical overview of MPN classification and management.

- Vainchenker W, Kralovics R. "Genetic basis and molecular pathophysiology of classical myeloproliferative neoplasms." *Blood*. 2017;129(6):667-679.
   - Covers JAK2 V617F and other driver mutations (CALR, MPL) in depth.

**Therapeutics / JAK Inhibitors:**
- Verstovsek S, Mesa RA, Gotlib J, et al. "A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of ruxolitinib for myelofibrosis." *New England Journal of Medicine*. 2012;366(9):799-807.
   - The pivotal COMFORT-I trial for ruxolitinib.

- Harrison C, Kiladjian JJ, Al-Ali HK, et al. "JAK inhibition with ruxolitinib versus best available therapy for myelofibrosis." *New England Journal of Medicine*. 2012;366(9):787-798.
   - COMFORT-II trial.

**Regulation:**
- Alexander WS, Hilton DJ. "The role of suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins in regulation of the immune response." *Annual Review of Immunology*. 2004;22:503-529.
   - Key review on SOCS-mediated negative feedback.

That gives you 11 references to start with, which covers most of your 8-source preliminary bibliography requirement with room to add more as you dive into the literature. I'd recommend searching PubMed and Google Scholar for more recent papers (2020-2025) on JAK2 V617F allele burden and newer inhibitors like momelotinib.

A few search strategies:
- PubMed: "JAK2 V617F myeloproliferative" filtered to reviews from the last 5 years
- Google Scholar: search for papers citing the Baxter 2005 or Levine 2005 papers to find downstream work
- Check the reference lists of the O'Shea 2015 and Vainchenker 2017 reviews — they'll point you to dozens of relevant primary papers

Would you like help organizing these into the outline, or do you have other questions about the content?

[10:43:15] jpark_2025:
no this is amazing actually. ill look those up on pubmed tonight. one more question - for the therapeutic section, should i focus more on ruxolitinib specifically or cover all the inhibitors equally?

[10:43:42] StudyBuddy AI Tutor:
Good question. I'd recommend a weighted approach rather than equal coverage:

**Primary focus on ruxolitinib** — it's the first-in-class JAK inhibitor approved for MPNs, it has the most clinical data (COMFORT-I and COMFORT-II trials), and it's the drug most students and readers will be familiar with. You can go into depth on its mechanism of action (competitive ATP-site inhibition of JAK1 and JAK2), its clinical trial results, and its limitations (anemia, thrombocytopenia, doesn't eliminate the malignant clone).

**Secondary coverage of other inhibitors** — fedratinib (JAK2-selective, approved for intermediate-2 or high-risk myelofibrosis), pacritinib (JAK2/IRAK1, approved for severely thrombocytopenic patients), and momelotinib (JAK1/JAK2/ACVR1, recently approved with a unique anemia benefit). You don't need to go as deep on these — a paragraph each covering what makes them distinct from ruxolitinib is sufficient.

**Brief mention of emerging strategies** — this is where you can be forward-looking. Mention allosteric JAK2 inhibitors, combination strategies (JAK inhibitor + BET inhibitor, JAK inhibitor + BCL-2 inhibitor), and PROTAC-based degraders. This shows Prof. Torres you've looked beyond the established literature.

That structure gives you depth where it matters most (ruxolitinib) while demonstrating breadth of knowledge. It also mirrors how the field actually developed — ruxolitinib first, then the next generation addressing its limitations.

For page allocation within a 12-15 page paper, I'd suggest roughly:
- Ruxolitinib: 1.5-2 pages
- Other approved inhibitors: 1-1.5 pages combined
- Emerging strategies: 0.5-1 page

Does that help with planning?

[10:44:58] jpark_2025:
yeah that makes a lot of sense. ok i think im good on the outline structure. let me ask one more thing - for the V617F section, how detailed should i get on the structural biology? like should i be talking about crystal structures and molecular dynamics or is that too much for a 301 level paper?

[10:45:30] StudyBuddy AI Tutor:
That's a thoughtful question about calibrating depth. For BIOL 301 — which is an advanced undergraduate course — I'd say you should reference structural biology but not make it the centerpiece. Here's how I'd calibrate it:

**Do include:**
- The basic structural explanation: V617F is in the JH2 (pseudokinase) domain, which normally autoinhibits the JH1 (kinase) domain. The phenylalanine substitution disrupts the JH2-JH1 interface, releasing autoinhibition.
- A mention of the crystal structure that revealed this mechanism (Bandaranayake et al., 2012 in *PNAS* is a good reference for the JAK2 pseudokinase domain structure).
- A figure or diagram showing the domain architecture and where V617F sits. You can create a simple schematic or reference a published figure.

**Optional / bonus:**
- Brief mention of molecular dynamics simulations that showed how V617F alters JH2 flexibility. This shows you've gone beyond the basics but doesn't require pages of structural detail.
- Comparison with other pseudokinase domain mutations (e.g., JAK2 exon 12 mutations) to show V617F isn't the only structural perturbation.

**Probably too deep for 301:**
- Detailed analysis of hydrogen bonding networks at the JH2-JH1 interface
- In-depth molecular dynamics methodology or free energy calculations
- Comparisons with other kinase pseudokinase domain structures across the kinome

The sweet spot for this level is: "explain the structural mechanism clearly enough that a reader understands WHY V617F causes constitutive activation, without turning it into a structural biology methods paper."

If Prof. Torres has particular interests — check if they've published on structural aspects of signaling — you might adjust accordingly. Some instructors love structural detail.

[10:47:12] jpark_2025:
haha good point ill check prof torres's publications. ok i think thats all i need for now

[10:47:25] jpark_2025:
actually wait one more thing. do you know if theres a good review from 2024 or 2025 on jak inhibitor resistance? that could be a good angle for the therapeutics section

[10:47:50] StudyBuddy AI Tutor:
Great instinct — resistance mechanisms are a hot topic and would strengthen your therapeutics section. I should note that my knowledge has a training cutoff, so I can point you toward the research landscape but you should verify specific recent publications yourself:

**What to search for:**
- PubMed query: "JAK2 inhibitor resistance myeloproliferative review" filtered to 2023-2025
- Key terms to look for: persistence of the malignant clone under JAK inhibitor therapy, heterodimeric JAK activation (where JAK2 V617F signals through JAK1 or TYK2 partners even when JAK2 is inhibited), acquisition of secondary mutations, and bone marrow fibrosis progression despite treatment

**Known resistance themes (as of my knowledge):**
1. **JAK2 V617F clone persistence** — ruxolitinib reduces symptoms and spleen size but doesn't eliminate the V617F clone in most patients. Allele burden often remains stable or rebounds.
2. **Heterodimerization escape** — JAK2 V617F can activate signaling through heterodimeric complexes with other JAKs, partially bypassing JAK2-targeted inhibition.
3. **Alternative pathway activation** — RAS/MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and NF-kB pathways can sustain proliferative signaling independent of JAK-STAT.
4. **Clonal evolution** — acquisition of additional mutations (e.g., in epigenetic regulators like TET2, ASXL1, EZH2) that drive disease progression independently of JAK2 status.

If you can find a 2024-2025 review that synthesizes these mechanisms, it would be a strong addition to your bibliography. Check the journals *Blood*, *Leukemia*, *Haematologica*, and *Nature Reviews Cancer* — those are the most likely venues for comprehensive MPN reviews.

One more tip: if you include a resistance section, it naturally sets up your "future directions" discussion in the conclusion. You can frame it as: "Current JAK inhibitors address symptom burden but not disease modification. Understanding resistance mechanisms is essential for developing next-generation therapies."

[10:49:22] jpark_2025:
perfect ill search for that tonight. ok im actually done now lol sorry for saying that twice

[10:49:35] jpark_2025:
ok thanks this is enough for the outline

[10:49:48] StudyBuddy AI Tutor:
No problem at all, Jiwon! You've got a really solid foundation here. Let me recap what you're walking away with:

1. **A detailed 8-section outline** covering molecular mechanism through therapeutics, focused on JAK2 and MPNs
2. **11 key references** organized by section to seed your bibliography
3. **Writing tips** for tone, specificity, and structure in cell biology papers
4. **Guidance on depth calibration** for the V617F structural biology section
5. **A strategy for the therapeutics section** (weighted toward ruxolitinib, with secondary coverage of newer inhibitors)
6. **Direction for finding recent resistance mechanism reviews**

Next steps I'd recommend:
- Start your PubMed literature search tonight as planned
- Flesh out the subsections in the outline with 1-2 sentence descriptions of what you'll cover
- Begin reading the foundational papers (Darnell 1994 and O'Shea 2015 are great starting points)
- Draft your introduction first since it frames everything else

Good luck with the paper! Feel free to come back if you want feedback on your draft or have questions as you dig into the literature. You've got plenty of time before the October 3 outline deadline and the November 14 paper deadline.

NOTABLE SESSION DETAILS (sampled for quality assurance):

--- Sample Session: SB-20250924-0022 ---
Student: placeholder_stu_022
Subject: Chemistry (Organic Chemistry II)
Duration: 25 minutes, 18 turns
Summary: Student working through SN1 vs SN2 reaction mechanism
  comparison. Asked about leaving group ability, carbocation
  stability, and solvent effects. Tutor walked through each
  factor with examples. Student worked three practice problems
  during the session, getting 2/3 correct on first attempt.
  Tutor provided corrective feedback on the incorrect answer
  (misidentified a neopentyl substrate as favoring SN2 due to
  branching). Student re-attempted and got it right.

--- Sample Session: SB-20250924-0045 ---
Student: placeholder_stu_045
Subject: Mathematics (Calculus III)
Duration: 32 minutes, 24 turns
Summary: Student preparing for midterm on multivariable calculus.
  Covered partial derivatives, gradient vectors, and directional
  derivatives. Student confused about the relationship between
  the gradient and level curves. Tutor provided a geometric
  explanation using contour maps and confirmed understanding
  with a practice problem. Student also asked about the chain
  rule for multivariable functions and worked through an example
  involving parametric curves on a surface.

--- Sample Session: SB-20250924-0078 ---
Student: placeholder_stu_078
Subject: Computer Science (Data Structures)
Duration: 28 minutes, 20 turns
Summary: Student debugging a binary search tree implementation
  in Python. Had an issue with the delete function not correctly
  handling the case where the node to be deleted has two children.
  Tutor walked through the in-order successor approach, explained
  why the student's code was replacing the node value but not
  recursively deleting the successor. Student fixed the code
  during the session and tested with several cases.

--- Sample Session: SB-20250924-0091 ---
Student: placeholder_stu_091
Subject: English (Composition II)
Duration: 18 minutes, 12 turns
Summary: Student submitted a draft argumentative essay on social
  media regulation for structural feedback. Tutor identified
  that the thesis statement was in the second paragraph rather
  than the introduction, that two body paragraphs made the same
  point with different examples (suggested consolidating), and
  that the counterargument section was underdeveloped. Student
  asked follow-up questions about how to strengthen the
  counterargument. Tutor suggested the student research specific
  First Amendment precedents rather than making general claims
  about free speech.

--- Sample Session: SB-20250924-0103 ---
Student: placeholder_stu_103
Subject: Physics (Electromagnetism)
Duration: 35 minutes, 26 turns
Summary: Student working through Gauss's Law problems for a
  homework assignment. Struggled with choosing appropriate
  Gaussian surfaces for non-symmetric charge distributions.
  Tutor explained the concept of symmetry exploitation and
  worked through three examples: infinite line charge (cylindrical
  surface), uniformly charged sphere (spherical surface), and
  infinite charged plane (pillbox surface). Student then attempted
  a problem involving a spherical shell with non-uniform surface
  charge and correctly identified that Gauss's Law alone wouldn't
  be sufficient for that case.

--- Sample Session: SB-20250924-0147 ---
Student: placeholder_stu_147
Subject: Economics (Microeconomics)
Duration: 22 minutes, 16 turns
Summary: Student reviewing price elasticity of demand for a
  problem set. Confused about the difference between elastic
  and inelastic demand and how total revenue changes in each
  case. Tutor provided the mathematical definition, then
  walked through a real-world example using gasoline (inelastic)
  vs luxury goods (elastic). Student worked through two
  calculation problems during the session. First calculation
  was correct. Second had an error in the percentage change
  calculation (used absolute change instead of percentage).
  Tutor identified the error and student corrected it.

--- Sample Session: SB-20250924-0165 ---
Student: placeholder_stu_165
Subject: History (Modern European History)
Duration: 20 minutes, 14 turns
Summary: Student working on a primary source analysis assignment
  for a document from the Congress of Vienna. Asked the tutor
  to help identify the rhetorical strategies used by Metternich
  in a speech excerpt. Tutor helped the student identify appeals
  to tradition, balance-of-power framing, and anti-revolutionary
  rhetoric. Student drafted analysis sentences during the session
  and asked for feedback on clarity. Tutor noted that one
  sentence conflated Metternich's personal views with Austrian
  state policy and suggested the student distinguish between the
  two.

--- Sample Session: SB-20250924-0179 ---
Student: placeholder_stu_179
Subject: Psychology (Research Methods)
Duration: 17 minutes, 12 turns
Summary: Student confused about the difference between
  correlation and causation in the context of their research
  methods class. Tutor explained confounding variables, the
  importance of random assignment, and the concept of the
  third-variable problem. Used an example about ice cream sales
  and drowning rates (confounded by temperature). Student asked
  about quasi-experimental designs and when they're appropriate.
  Tutor explained situations where random assignment is
  impractical or unethical.

Shift:            Morning (08:00-16:00 UTC)
On-duty analysts:  2 (standard staffing)

ITEMS FOR REVIEW:

1. ANOMALY-2025-0924-001 (received 11:15 UTC)
   Status: Under review
   Assigned to: Automated queue (pending analyst pickup)
   Priority: Medium
   Notes: 14 BIOL 301 students submitted outline-generation
     requests within a 3-hour window. Keyword filters did not
     trigger on any of the 14 sessions. All sessions tagged as
     "brainstorming" or "outline_generation." Common reference
     to Prof. Torres and a term paper assignment. Initial
     automated assessment: possible coordinated activity, but
     the explicit mention of an instructor assignment across
     multiple sessions may indicate legitimate class-directed
     usage. Awaiting analyst review.

   Analyst notes (added 11:45 UTC):
     Reviewing session transcripts. Multiple students
     referenced the same assignment text from Prof. Torres
     instructing them to "use the StudyBuddy AI tutor to
     brainstorm." Cross-checking against the course-assignment
     registry — BIOL 301 does not currently have a registered
     assignment in the system. Reaching out to academic
     partnerships team to confirm whether Prof. Torres
     submitted an assignment notification.

   Analyst notes (added 13:20 UTC):
     Academic partnerships confirmed that Prof. Torres's
     BIOL 301 assignment was posted on the course LMS on
     2025-09-22. The assignment explicitly directs students
     to use StudyBuddy for brainstorming outlines. The
     assignment was not pre-registered in the platform's
     course-assignment registry (instructor did not use the
     optional notification form). Recommendation: close alert
     as legitimate, update course-assignment registry, and
     send reminder to academic partnerships team about
     encouraging instructor pre-registration.

2. Routine keyword filter triggers (3 today)
   All three triggers resulted in appropriate tutor responses
   (declined and redirected). No escalation needed.
   Sessions: SB-20250924-0089, SB-20250924-0112, SB-20250924-0156

3. No other anomaly alerts today.

SHIFT SUMMARY:
  Alerts processed:    1 anomaly, 3 keyword triggers
  Escalations:         0
  Policy updates:      None
  Account actions:     None
  Notes: Quiet day. The BIOL 301 outline spike was the only
    notable item. Recommend updating the instructor onboarding
    materials to emphasize the course-assignment pre-registration
    form, which would have prevented this false positive.
