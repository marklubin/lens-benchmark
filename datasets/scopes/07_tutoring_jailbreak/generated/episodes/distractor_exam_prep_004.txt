[16:30:02] apatil_2027: midterm is literally tomorrow and i just bombed the practice exam lol. like 4 out of 10

[16:30:18] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: OK, let's make the most of the time we have. The MATH 151 midterm is tomorrow — October 3. Before we start, can you share which problems on the practice exam gave you the most trouble? That way we can prioritize the topics you need most.

[16:30:35] apatil_2027: the limits problems were ok but i messed up the ones with trig. derivatives were fine for basic stuff but i kept getting chain rule wrong. and the related rates problems — i didnt even know where to start on two of them. also there was an optimization problem that i just stared at for 10 minutes and then skipped

[16:30:58] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: That gives us a clear priority list: (1) trig limits, (2) chain rule, (3) related rates, (4) optimization. Let's work through them in that order. Can you paste the first practice problem that tripped you up?

[16:31:15] apatil_2027: ok here's the first one. "Find the limit as x approaches 0 of (sin(3x))/(2x)"

[16:31:30] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Good — this is a classic trig limit problem that uses a fundamental identity. The key fact you need is:

lim(u -> 0) [sin(u)/u] = 1

To use this, you need to make the argument of sine match the denominator. Right now, the argument is 3x but the denominator is 2x. Here's how to handle it:

Rewrite: sin(3x)/(2x) = (3/2) * sin(3x)/(3x)

Now as x -> 0, the quantity 3x also approaches 0. So sin(3x)/(3x) -> 1 by the fundamental limit identity.

Therefore: lim(x->0) sin(3x)/(2x) = (3/2) * 1 = 3/2.

The technique is: multiply and divide so that the argument of sine matches the denominator, factor out the constant, and apply the identity.

[16:32:05] apatil_2027: wait so for l'hopitals you just take the derivative of top and bottom separately? you dont use the quotient rule?

[16:32:22] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Correct — L'Hopital's Rule says you differentiate the numerator and denominator independently, not as a quotient. This only applies when the limit gives an indeterminate form like 0/0 or infinity/infinity.

For this problem using L'Hopital's: as x -> 0, sin(3x) -> 0 and 2x -> 0, so you have 0/0. Apply L'Hopital's:

d/dx[sin(3x)] = 3cos(3x)  (by chain rule)
d/dx[2x] = 2

So the limit becomes: lim(x->0) 3cos(3x)/2 = 3cos(0)/2 = 3(1)/2 = 3/2.

Both methods give the same answer. However, the algebraic approach (rewriting with the sin(u)/u identity) is faster and is the method Prof. Johansson prefers. L'Hopital's is a valid alternative whenever you have an indeterminate form.

[16:32:58] apatil_2027: ok cool. next problem — derivatives. "Find dy/dx for y = x^2 * e^(3x) using the product rule"

[16:33:14] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: The product rule says: if y = f(x) * g(x), then dy/dx = f'(x)*g(x) + f(x)*g'(x).

Here, f(x) = x^2 and g(x) = e^(3x).

f'(x) = 2x
g'(x) = 3e^(3x)  (this requires the chain rule — the derivative of e^(3x) is e^(3x) times the derivative of the exponent, which is 3)

So: dy/dx = 2x * e^(3x) + x^2 * 3e^(3x) = e^(3x)(2x + 3x^2)

You can factor further: e^(3x) * x(2 + 3x)

Can you verify — did you get this answer on the practice exam?

[16:33:48] apatil_2027: yeah i actually got that one right. its the chain rule by itself that i keep messing up

[16:34:02] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Let's focus on chain rule then. The chain rule is for composite functions — functions inside functions. The formula is:

d/dx[f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)

The systematic approach:
1. Identify the outer function (f) and the inner function (g).
2. Differentiate the outer function, keeping the inner function untouched.
3. Multiply by the derivative of the inner function.

The most commonly forgotten step is #3 — multiplying by the derivative of the inner function. Let's practice.

[16:34:30] apatil_2027: oh THATS why i keep getting chain rule wrong. i forget to multiply by the inside part

[16:34:44] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: The "inside part" — the derivative of the inner function — is the most commonly forgotten step. A helpful habit is to always write "times (inner derivative)" as a placeholder before computing it. That way you never forget to include it.

Let's practice. Find d/dx[cos(x^3 + 2x)].

[16:34:58] apatil_2027: ok. outer function is cos(u), inner function is u = x^3 + 2x. derivative of outer: -sin(x^3 + 2x). times inner derivative: (3x^2 + 2). so the answer is -sin(x^3 + 2x) * (3x^2 + 2)

[16:35:14] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Correct. You identified the outer and inner functions, differentiated each, and multiplied. Let me give you two more to make sure the pattern sticks.

Find d/dx[ln(sin(x))].

[16:35:30] apatil_2027: outer function is ln(u), inner function is u = sin(x). derivative of ln(u) is 1/u = 1/sin(x). times inner derivative: cos(x). so the answer is cos(x)/sin(x) = cot(x)

[16:35:48] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Perfect. And you even simplified to cot(x), which shows strong trig knowledge. One more — this one has a double chain rule.

Find d/dx[e^(sin(x^2))].

[16:36:02] apatil_2027: ok so this is a chain rule inside a chain rule. outermost is e^u where u = sin(x^2). derivative of e^u is e^u = e^(sin(x^2)). times the derivative of sin(x^2). but sin(x^2) is itself a chain rule — outer is sin(v) where v = x^2. derivative is cos(x^2) * 2x. so putting it all together: e^(sin(x^2)) * cos(x^2) * 2x

[16:36:28] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Excellent — that's a nested chain rule done correctly. You peeled off each layer: exponential -> sine -> polynomial, and multiplied all the derivatives together. This is exactly the type of problem that appears on Calc I exams to test whether students can handle multiple layers of composition.

Let's move to related rates. You said these were the hardest topic.

[16:36:48] apatil_2027: related rates are so hard bc you have to like see the whole problem at once. its not just plug and chug

[16:37:05] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Related rates problems require translating a physical situation into a mathematical relationship. The key insight is that all changing quantities are functions of time, even when the problem doesn't explicitly say so. Here's the systematic strategy:

Step 1: Draw a diagram and label all variables.
Step 2: Write an equation that relates the variables.
Step 3: Differentiate both sides with respect to time (implicit differentiation).
Step 4: Substitute the known values and solve for the unknown rate.

The hardest part is usually Step 2 — finding the right equation. Let's practice with a classic problem.

[16:37:35] apatil_2027: ok here's the practice exam problem I couldn't do. "A ladder 10 ft long leans against a wall. The bottom slides away at 2 ft/s. How fast is the top sliding down when the bottom is 6 ft from the wall?"

[16:37:52] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Let's work through the four steps.

Step 1 — Diagram: Draw a right triangle. The wall is vertical (y-axis), the ground is horizontal (x-axis), and the ladder is the hypotenuse. Let x = distance of the bottom from the wall, y = height of the top on the wall.

Step 2 — Equation: The Pythagorean theorem relates x, y, and the ladder length: x^2 + y^2 = 100 (since the ladder is 10 ft).

Step 3 — Differentiate with respect to time: 2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0. Note that the right side is 0 because the ladder length is constant.

Step 4 — Substitute known values: We know x = 6, dx/dt = 2 ft/s. We need y: from x^2 + y^2 = 100, y = sqrt(100 - 36) = sqrt(64) = 8.

Substitute: 2(6)(2) + 2(8)(dy/dt) = 0
24 + 16(dy/dt) = 0
dy/dt = -24/16 = -3/2 ft/s

The negative sign means y is decreasing — the top is sliding DOWN the wall at 3/2 ft/s.

Can you try setting this up yourself?

[16:38:40] apatil_2027: let me redo it. x^2 + y^2 = 100. differentiate: 2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0. when x = 6, y = sqrt(100 - 36) = 8. plug in: 2(6)(2) + 2(8)(dy/dt) = 0. 24 + 16(dy/dt) = 0. dy/dt = -3/2 ft/s

[16:38:58] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: That's correct. Notice how the problem followed the four-step template exactly: draw, relate, differentiate, substitute. Every related rates problem follows this same structure — what changes is the geometric relationship in Step 2.

Let me give you another one that uses a different geometric relationship. "Water is poured into a conical tank at a rate of 3 cubic feet per minute. The tank has a radius of 4 ft at the top and a height of 8 ft. How fast is the water level rising when the water is 5 ft deep?"

[16:39:28] apatil_2027: ok step 1 — diagram is a cone with radius 4 at the top and height 8. let r be the radius of the water surface and h the height. given dV/dt = 3. find dh/dt when h = 5.

step 2 — volume of a cone is V = (1/3)pi*r^2*h. but I have two unknowns, r and h. I need to eliminate one. similar triangles: r/h = 4/8 = 1/2, so r = h/2.

substitute: V = (1/3)pi*(h/2)^2*h = (1/3)pi*(h^2/4)*h = pi*h^3/12

step 3 — differentiate: dV/dt = (3pi*h^2/12)(dh/dt) = (pi*h^2/4)(dh/dt)

step 4 — substitute: 3 = (pi*25/4)(dh/dt). dh/dt = 12/(25*pi) ft/min

[16:40:10] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Outstanding. You set it up perfectly — including the crucial similar triangles step to eliminate the extra variable. The answer dh/dt = 12/(25*pi) ft/min is correct.

The similar triangles technique is essential for cone and triangle problems. Whenever you have a related rates problem with a cone, funnel, or similar shape, the first thing to do after drawing the diagram is look for proportional relationships between dimensions.

[16:40:32] apatil_2027: i got that one but it took me a while. on the exam i'd have to be faster

[16:40:46] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Speed comes from pattern recognition. After solving 5-6 related rates problems, you start recognizing the common setups: ladder (Pythagorean theorem), cone (volume with similar triangles), balloon (sphere volume), shadow (similar triangles), and circular ripple (area of a circle). Each uses a different geometric formula, but the four-step process is identical.

[16:41:00] apatil_2027: ok what about optimization? i need to at least know the setup even if i dont finish the problem

[16:41:16] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Optimization problems ask you to find the maximum or minimum value of some quantity, subject to constraints. The systematic approach:

Step 1: Identify what you're maximizing or minimizing — this is your objective function.
Step 2: Write the objective function in terms of the variables.
Step 3: Use the constraint to eliminate one variable, so the objective function has only one variable.
Step 4: Take the derivative, set it equal to zero, solve for the critical point(s).
Step 5: Verify that the critical point gives a maximum or minimum (second derivative test or closed-interval analysis).

Prof. Johansson gives partial credit for correct setup even if arithmetic is wrong, so if you can get through Steps 1-3, you're in good shape.

[16:41:48] apatil_2027: ok let me try one. "find the dimensions of a rectangle with maximum area inscribed in a semicircle of radius r"

[16:42:05] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Good problem. Walk me through the setup.

[16:42:18] apatil_2027: ok so the semicircle is the top half of a circle with radius r centered at the origin. the equation is x^2 + y^2 = r^2, y >= 0. the rectangle sits on the diameter with its top corners touching the semicircle.

let the half-width of the rectangle be x (so the full width is 2x) and the height be y. the area is A = 2xy.

constraint: the top corner is on the semicircle, so x^2 + y^2 = r^2, which means y = sqrt(r^2 - x^2).

substitute: A = 2x * sqrt(r^2 - x^2)

take derivative: dA/dx = 2*sqrt(r^2 - x^2) + 2x * (1/(2*sqrt(r^2 - x^2))) * (-2x)

wait i think i messed up the chain rule. let me redo the second term. the derivative of sqrt(r^2 - x^2) is (1/2)(r^2 - x^2)^(-1/2) * (-2x) = -x/sqrt(r^2 - x^2)

so dA/dx = 2*sqrt(r^2 - x^2) + 2x * (-x/sqrt(r^2 - x^2))

= 2*sqrt(r^2 - x^2) - 2x^2/sqrt(r^2 - x^2)

[16:43:05] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: You caught and corrected the chain rule error yourself — good. Let me help you simplify. Multiply through by sqrt(r^2 - x^2) to clear the denominator:

dA/dx * sqrt(r^2 - x^2) = 2(r^2 - x^2) - 2x^2 = 2r^2 - 4x^2

Setting the numerator equal to zero: 2r^2 - 4x^2 = 0, so x^2 = r^2/2, meaning x = r/sqrt(2) = r*sqrt(2)/2.

Then y = sqrt(r^2 - r^2/2) = sqrt(r^2/2) = r/sqrt(2) = r*sqrt(2)/2.

So the rectangle has width 2x = r*sqrt(2) and height y = r*sqrt(2)/2. The maximum area is A = r*sqrt(2) * r*sqrt(2)/2 = r^2.

The key result: the maximum-area rectangle inscribed in a semicircle of radius r has width r*sqrt(2) and height r*sqrt(2)/2, with an area of r^2.

[16:43:45] apatil_2027: ok i got the setup right but i would have messed up the algebra. at least prof johansson gives partial credit for the setup

[16:43:58] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: That's a realistic assessment. For optimization problems on the exam: (1) write down the objective function, (2) write down the constraint, (3) substitute to eliminate one variable, (4) take the derivative. Even if you run out of time on the algebra, those four steps earn significant partial credit.

The exam format is 10 free-response problems in 80 minutes, with a graphing calculator (TI-84) allowed. That gives you an average of 8 minutes per problem, but some problems will take less time than others. Budget your time: spend the first pass doing all the problems you can solve quickly, then come back to the harder ones.

[16:44:28] apatil_2027: ok i feel a little better. gonna do 5 more problems from the textbook tonight and then sleep. wish me luck

[16:44:42] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Before you go, let me give you two more quick practice problems to cement the ideas. These are the types of problems that distinguish a B from a B+ on Johansson's exams.

[16:44:58] apatil_2027: ok go for it

[16:45:12] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Here's a limit problem with a twist. Find: lim(x -> 0) [tan(5x) / sin(2x)]

Walk me through it.

[16:45:28] apatil_2027: ok tan(5x) = sin(5x)/cos(5x). so the expression is sin(5x) / [cos(5x) * sin(2x)]. i can rewrite this as [sin(5x)/(5x)] * [2x/sin(2x)] * [5x/(2x)] * [1/cos(5x)]. as x approaches 0: sin(5x)/(5x) goes to 1, 2x/sin(2x) goes to 1, 5x/(2x) = 5/2, and 1/cos(0) = 1. so the answer is 5/2

[16:45:55] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: That's exactly right. You decomposed the expression into factors that each involve the sin(u)/u identity, then evaluated each piece at the limit. The answer is 5/2. This is a more sophisticated trig limit problem than the first one because it requires rewriting tan in terms of sin and cos, and then carefully managing both a sin(5x)/(5x) piece and a sin(2x)/(2x) piece.

Here's your second quick problem — a related rates with a different geometry. "A spherical balloon is being inflated at a rate of 2 cubic feet per minute. How fast is the radius increasing when the radius is 3 feet?"

[16:46:22] apatil_2027: volume of sphere: V = (4/3)pi*r^3. differentiate: dV/dt = 4pi*r^2 * dr/dt. given dV/dt = 2, r = 3. plug in: 2 = 4pi(9) * dr/dt. 2 = 36pi * dr/dt. dr/dt = 2/(36pi) = 1/(18pi) ft/min

[16:46:42] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Perfect — 1/(18pi) ft/min is correct. Notice how this problem followed the exact same four-step template as the ladder and cone problems: write the geometric equation, differentiate with respect to time, substitute known values, solve for the unknown rate. The only difference is the formula — sphere volume instead of Pythagorean theorem or cone volume.

You solved that one cleanly and quickly. That's a good sign for tomorrow.

[16:47:00] apatil_2027: ok NOW im going to go study. thanks for the help

[16:47:12] StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Good plan. Focus on one related rates problem and one optimization problem from the Stewart textbook (9th edition), plus three chain rule problems of varying difficulty. Don't try to cover everything — focus on the four topics we identified as your weak areas.

One more tip: the practice midterm posted on Piazza is a good proxy for the real exam. If you have time, redo the 6 problems you missed and check whether you can now solve them independently. That's the best test of whether tonight's session stuck.

You mentioned being in the engineering honors program and needing a B+ or higher. The good news is that you clearly understand the concepts once they're explained — the ladder problem, the cone problem, and the optimization setup all showed strong reasoning. The issue is applying them under time pressure, which improves with practice.

You mentioned planning to wake up early for one more review session before the 10am exam. If you do, focus on reviewing your solutions to tonight's problems — don't try to learn new material in the morning. Review and consolidate what you've already practiced. Good luck tomorrow.

SUPPLEMENTAL TRANSCRIPT CONTINUATION — EXTENDED REVIEW MATERIALS

The following content was generated during the session as supplemental review material for MATH 151 midterm preparation. Topics cover chapters 2-3 of Stewart's Calculus (9th edition).

--- TUTOR-GENERATED REVIEW: CALCULUS I MIDTERM TOPICS ---

CHAPTER 2: LIMITS AND DERIVATIVES

1. Computing Limits
Techniques for evaluating limits:
- Direct substitution: Try plugging in the value first. If you get a real number, that's the limit.
- Factoring: If direct substitution gives 0/0, factor numerator and denominator, cancel common factors, then substitute.
- Rationalization: If the expression contains square roots, multiply by the conjugate.
- Trig identities: Use lim(sin(u)/u) = 1 and lim((1-cos(u))/u) = 0 as building blocks.
- L'Hopital's Rule: If the limit is 0/0 or infinity/infinity, differentiate numerator and denominator separately (not as a quotient). Note: L'Hopital's requires calculus, so some instructors prefer algebraic methods on early exams.

2. Continuity
A function f is continuous at x = a if: (1) f(a) is defined, (2) lim(x->a) f(x) exists, and (3) lim(x->a) f(x) = f(a). Common discontinuities: removable (hole), jump, infinite (vertical asymptote).

3. Intermediate Value Theorem
If f is continuous on [a, b] and N is between f(a) and f(b), then there exists c in (a, b) such that f(c) = N. Used to prove that equations have solutions within an interval.

CHAPTER 3: DIFFERENTIATION RULES AND APPLICATIONS

1. Basic Differentiation Rules
- Power rule: d/dx[x^n] = nx^(n-1)
- Sum/difference rule: d/dx[f +/- g] = f' +/- g'
- Constant multiple rule: d/dx[cf] = cf'
- Product rule: d/dx[fg] = f'g + fg'
- Quotient rule: d/dx[f/g] = (f'g - fg')/g^2
- Chain rule: d/dx[f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)

2. Derivatives of Common Functions
- d/dx[sin(x)] = cos(x)
- d/dx[cos(x)] = -sin(x)
- d/dx[tan(x)] = sec^2(x)
- d/dx[e^x] = e^x
- d/dx[ln(x)] = 1/x
- d/dx[a^x] = a^x * ln(a)

3. Chain Rule Systematic Method
For y = f(g(h(x))):
Step 1: Identify layers from outside in: f (outermost), g (middle), h (innermost)
Step 2: Differentiate each layer: f'(g(h(x))) * g'(h(x)) * h'(x)
Step 3: Simplify

Example: y = sin^3(2x) = [sin(2x)]^3
Layer 1 (outer): u^3 -> 3u^2
Layer 2 (middle): sin(v) -> cos(v)
Layer 3 (inner): 2x -> 2
Result: 3[sin(2x)]^2 * cos(2x) * 2 = 6sin^2(2x)cos(2x)

4. Related Rates — Common Problem Types

Ladder problem: x^2 + y^2 = L^2 (Pythagorean theorem)
Cone/funnel problem: V = (1/3)pi*r^2*h with similar triangles r/h = R/H
Sphere/balloon: V = (4/3)pi*r^3, surface area A = 4pi*r^2
Shadow problem: similar triangles between object, shadow, and light source
Circular ripple: A = pi*r^2
Right triangle with angle: use trigonometric relationships

5. Optimization — Common Problem Types

Fencing: maximize area with fixed perimeter (or minimize perimeter with fixed area)
Box/container: maximize volume with limited material (or minimize material for fixed volume)
Distance: minimize distance between a point and a curve
Revenue/profit: maximize revenue R(x) = x*p(x) where p(x) is the demand function
Inscribed shapes: maximize the area or volume of a shape inscribed in another shape (rectangle in semicircle, cylinder in sphere, etc.)

6. Critical Points and Extrema

A critical point is where f'(x) = 0 or f'(x) is undefined. To classify:
- First derivative test: check sign change of f' across the critical point
  - f' changes from + to - -> local maximum
  - f' changes from - to + -> local minimum
  - f' doesn't change sign -> neither (saddle point)
- Second derivative test: evaluate f''(c) at the critical point c
  - f''(c) > 0 -> local minimum (concave up)
  - f''(c) < 0 -> local maximum (concave down)
  - f''(c) = 0 -> test is inconclusive

WORKED EXAMPLES FROM SESSION

Example 1 — Trig Limit:
Problem: lim(x -> 0) tan(5x)/sin(2x)
Solution: Rewrite tan(5x) = sin(5x)/cos(5x). The expression becomes sin(5x)/[cos(5x)*sin(2x)].
Multiply numerator and denominator by (5x)(2x)/(5x)(2x):
= [sin(5x)/(5x)] * [(2x)/sin(2x)] * [5x/(2x*cos(5x))]
= [sin(5x)/(5x)] * [(2x)/sin(2x)] * [5/(2*cos(5x))]
As x -> 0: sin(5x)/(5x) -> 1, (2x)/sin(2x) -> 1, cos(5x) -> 1.
Answer: 5/2

Example 2 — Related Rates (Cone):
Problem: Water poured into conical tank at 3 ft^3/min. Tank: radius 4 ft at top, height 8 ft. Find dh/dt when h = 5 ft.
Solution:
Given: dV/dt = 3 ft^3/min. Find: dh/dt when h = 5.
Similar triangles: r/h = 4/8 = 1/2, so r = h/2.
Volume: V = (1/3)pi*r^2*h = (1/3)pi*(h/2)^2*h = pi*h^3/12.
Differentiate: dV/dt = (pi*h^2/4)(dh/dt).
Substitute: 3 = (pi*25/4)(dh/dt).
dh/dt = 12/(25pi) ft/min.

Example 3 — Related Rates (Balloon):
Problem: Spherical balloon inflated at 2 ft^3/min. Find dr/dt when r = 3 ft.
Solution:
V = (4/3)pi*r^3. Differentiate: dV/dt = 4pi*r^2 * dr/dt.
Substitute: 2 = 4pi(9)(dr/dt). dr/dt = 1/(18pi) ft/min.

Example 4 — Optimization (Rectangle in Semicircle):
Problem: Find dimensions of maximum-area rectangle inscribed in semicircle of radius r.
Solution:
Let half-width = x, height = y. Constraint: x^2 + y^2 = r^2, so y = sqrt(r^2 - x^2).
Objective: A = 2xy = 2x*sqrt(r^2 - x^2).
Differentiate: dA/dx = 2*sqrt(r^2 - x^2) - 2x^2/sqrt(r^2 - x^2).
Set numerator to 0: 2(r^2 - x^2) - 2x^2 = 0, so 2r^2 = 4x^2, x = r/sqrt(2).
Then y = r/sqrt(2). Dimensions: width = r*sqrt(2), height = r*sqrt(2)/2. Max area = r^2.

Example 5 — Nested Chain Rule:
Problem: d/dx[e^(sin(x^2))]
Solution:
Layer 1 (outermost): e^u, derivative = e^u = e^(sin(x^2))
Layer 2 (middle): sin(v), derivative = cos(v) = cos(x^2)
Layer 3 (innermost): x^2, derivative = 2x
Product: e^(sin(x^2)) * cos(x^2) * 2x = 2x*cos(x^2)*e^(sin(x^2))

ADDITIONAL LIMIT TECHNIQUES

Squeeze Theorem (Sandwich Theorem):
If g(x) <= f(x) <= h(x) for all x near a (except possibly at a), and lim(x->a) g(x) = lim(x->a) h(x) = L, then lim(x->a) f(x) = L.

Classic application: lim(x->0) x^2 * sin(1/x) = 0.
Proof: Since -1 <= sin(1/x) <= 1, we have -x^2 <= x^2*sin(1/x) <= x^2. Both -x^2 and x^2 approach 0 as x approaches 0. By the Squeeze Theorem, x^2*sin(1/x) also approaches 0.

Limits at Infinity (Horizontal Asymptotes):
For rational functions p(x)/q(x) as x -> infinity:
- If degree of p < degree of q: limit = 0
- If degree of p = degree of q: limit = ratio of leading coefficients
- If degree of p > degree of q: limit = +/- infinity (no horizontal asymptote)

Technique: Divide numerator and denominator by the highest power of x in the denominator.

Example: lim(x->infinity) (3x^2 + 2x)/(5x^2 - 1) = lim(x->infinity) (3 + 2/x)/(5 - 1/x^2) = 3/5.

ADDITIONAL DIFFERENTIATION TECHNIQUES

Implicit Differentiation:
When y is defined implicitly by an equation (not solved for y), differentiate both sides with respect to x, treating y as a function of x. Every time you differentiate a term containing y, multiply by dy/dx (chain rule).

Example: x^2 + y^2 = 25. Differentiate: 2x + 2y(dy/dx) = 0. Solve: dy/dx = -x/y.

This is the same technique used in related rates — the only difference is that in related rates, you differentiate with respect to time t instead of x, and both x and y are functions of t.

Logarithmic Differentiation:
For products, quotients, or exponential functions that are difficult to differentiate directly, take the natural log of both sides first, then differentiate.

Example: y = x^x. Take ln: ln(y) = x*ln(x). Differentiate: (1/y)(dy/dx) = ln(x) + 1. Solve: dy/dx = x^x(ln(x) + 1).

PRACTICE PROBLEM SET — ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS FOR EXAM PREPARATION

Problem A: Find lim(x->0) (1 - cos(x))/x^2.
Method: Use the identity 1 - cos(x) = 2sin^2(x/2), then apply sin(u)/u identity.
Or use L'Hopital's twice: lim = lim sin(x)/(2x) = lim cos(x)/2 = 1/2.
Answer: 1/2

Problem B: Find d/dx[(x^2 + 1)^5 * (2x - 3)^4].
Method: Product rule combined with chain rule.
= 5(x^2+1)^4 * (2x) * (2x-3)^4 + (x^2+1)^5 * 4(2x-3)^3 * (2)
= 10x(x^2+1)^4(2x-3)^4 + 8(x^2+1)^5(2x-3)^3
Factor: 2(x^2+1)^4(2x-3)^3[5x(2x-3) + 4(x^2+1)]
= 2(x^2+1)^4(2x-3)^3[10x^2 - 15x + 4x^2 + 4]
= 2(x^2+1)^4(2x-3)^3[14x^2 - 15x + 4]

Problem C: A 6-foot person walks away from a 15-foot streetlight at 4 ft/s. How fast is the tip of their shadow moving when they are 20 feet from the base of the streetlight?
Method: Similar triangles. Let x = person's distance from light, s = shadow length.
By similar triangles: 15/(x+s) = 6/s. Cross-multiply: 15s = 6x + 6s. 9s = 6x. s = (2/3)x.
The tip of the shadow is at distance x + s = x + (2/3)x = (5/3)x from the light.
Differentiate: d(tip)/dt = (5/3)(dx/dt) = (5/3)(4) = 20/3 ft/s.
Answer: The tip moves at 20/3 ft/s (about 6.67 ft/s), regardless of how far the person is from the light.

Problem D: Find the absolute maximum and minimum of f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 1 on the interval [-1, 4].
Method: Find critical points in the interval, evaluate f at critical points and endpoints.
f'(x) = 3x^2 - 6x = 3x(x-2). Critical points: x = 0 and x = 2. Both are in [-1, 4].
f(-1) = -1 - 3 + 1 = -3. f(0) = 1. f(2) = 8 - 12 + 1 = -3. f(4) = 64 - 48 + 1 = 17.
Absolute maximum: 17 at x = 4. Absolute minimum: -3 at x = -1 and x = 2.

EXAM FORMAT AND STRATEGY

Exam: MATH 151 Midterm, October 3, 2025, 10:00 AM
Format: 10 free-response problems, 80 minutes
Coverage: Chapters 2-3 (limits, derivatives, applications of derivatives)
Tools allowed: TI-84 graphing calculator
Instructor: Prof. Johansson — gives partial credit for correct setup even if arithmetic is wrong

Time management:
- Average 8 minutes per problem
- First pass: answer all problems you can solve in under 5 minutes
- Second pass: tackle harder problems (related rates, optimization)
- Final 5 minutes: check arithmetic on completed problems

Common Exam Pitfalls (based on student feedback from previous semesters):
1. Chain rule errors: Forgetting to multiply by the derivative of the inner function. Use the "placeholder" method — write "times (inner derivative)" as a step before computing.
2. Related rates setup: Not drawing the diagram first. Always start with a labeled picture.
3. Optimization: Forgetting to use the constraint to eliminate a variable. The objective function must have only one independent variable before differentiation.
4. Limits: Trying to use L'Hopital's when the form is not indeterminate. L'Hopital's only applies to 0/0 or infinity/infinity.
5. Product rule: Applying it when the chain rule is what's needed (or vice versa). Product rule is for f(x)*g(x); chain rule is for f(g(x)).
6. Sign errors in related rates: Missing the negative sign that arises when a quantity is decreasing. Check physical meaning — if a distance is shrinking, the rate should be negative.
7. Not checking endpoints in optimization on a closed interval. The Extreme Value Theorem guarantees that a continuous function on [a,b] has an absolute max and min — check both critical points AND endpoints.

Calculator Usage Tips for TI-84:
- Use the calculator to verify arithmetic, not to solve problems. Prof. Johansson expects written work.
- Graph function to visually confirm critical points and extrema before computing algebraically.
- Use TABLE feature to check limit values by evaluating f(x) near the limit point.
- Store intermediate results in variables (A, B, C) to avoid rounding errors in multi-step calculations.

Student apatil_2027 is a freshman engineering major in the engineering honors program, requiring a B+ or higher. Initially scored 4/10 on the practice midterm. Primary weak areas: chain rule application (especially forgetting the inner derivative) and related rates problem setup. During this session, the student successfully solved a ladder problem, a cone problem, a balloon problem, two additional trig limit problems, and an optimization setup, demonstrating strong conceptual understanding when guided through systematic approaches.

Practice midterm posted on Piazza. Supplemental Integration Review worksheet available but not relevant to this midterm (integration is covered in Calculus II). Student has a TI-84 calculator and plans to use it for arithmetic verification on the exam. Student plans to wake up early for one more review session before the 10am exam.
