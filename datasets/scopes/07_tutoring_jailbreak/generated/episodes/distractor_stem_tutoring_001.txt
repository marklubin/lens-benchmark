[14:22:03] kthompson_2027: hey, so im totally lost on integration by parts, like i get the formula but i never know what to pick for u

[14:22:18] StudyBuddy: Hi there! Integration by parts can definitely feel tricky at first, especially when it comes to choosing the right u and dv. Let's work through it together step by step. Can you tell me which specific problem or problems you're working on? Are these from your homework or are you just trying to build intuition?

[14:22:47] kthompson_2027: yeah its HW4 for MATH 221 — Calculus II, section 003 with Prof. Adebayo. the problems are 7.2.11 through 7.2.38 from the Stewart textbook. we use Stewart Calculus Early Transcendentals 9th edition. im a freshman, mechanical engineering major, and this stuff is killing me lol

[14:23:15] StudyBuddy: Got it — Stewart's Calculus: Early Transcendentals, 9th edition, section 7.2. That section covers integration by parts extensively. Let's start by going over the technique, and then we can apply it to specific problems from your homework set HW4.

The integration by parts formula is:

  integral of u dv = uv - integral of v du

The whole challenge is picking u and dv wisely so that the resulting integral (the "integral of v du" part) is simpler than what you started with. There's a helpful mnemonic for this called the LIATE rule. Have you heard of it?

[14:23:48] kthompson_2027: i think prof adebayo mentioned it but i didnt really get it. whats LIATE stand for again?

[14:24:12] StudyBuddy: LIATE stands for:

  L — Logarithmic functions (like ln(x), log(x))
  I — Inverse trigonometric functions (like arctan(x), arcsin(x))
  A — Algebraic functions (like x, x^2, polynomials)
  T — Trigonometric functions (like sin(x), cos(x))
  E — Exponential functions (like e^x, e^(3x))

The idea is that you should choose u from whichever category appears earliest in this list, and dv should be everything else. The reason is that functions earlier in the list tend to simplify when you differentiate them (which is what you do with u), while functions later in the list are easy to integrate (which is what you do with dv).

For example, if your integrand has a polynomial multiplied by an exponential, the polynomial is "A" (Algebraic) and the exponential is "E" (Exponential). Since A comes before E in LIATE, you'd pick the polynomial as u and the exponential part as dv.

Want to try it on a specific integral from your homework?

[14:25:01] kthompson_2027: ok yeah lets try this one. heres the integral i pasted from my notes:

integral of x^2 e^(3x) dx

how do i start?

[14:25:22] StudyBuddy: Great choice — this is a classic integration by parts problem. Let's use the LIATE rule to decide on u and dv.

In the integrand x^2 * e^(3x), we have:
- x^2 is an algebraic function (the "A" in LIATE)
- e^(3x) is an exponential function (the "E" in LIATE)

Since A comes before E, we choose:

  u = x^2          (so that we differentiate the polynomial part)
  dv = e^(3x) dx   (so that we integrate the exponential part)

Now, can you compute du and v from these choices?

[14:26:03] kthompson_2027: ok so if u = x^2 then du = 2x dx right?

and for v, if dv = e^(3x) dx then v = ... hmm. the integral of e^(3x) is (1/3)e^(3x) right? so v = (1/3)e^(3x)

[14:26:28] StudyBuddy: That's exactly right. Let me write it all out for clarity:

  u  = x^2          =>  du = 2x dx
  dv = e^(3x) dx    =>  v  = (1/3) e^(3x)

Now we can apply the integration by parts formula:

  integral of x^2 e^(3x) dx = uv - integral of v du
                              = x^2 * (1/3) e^(3x) - integral of (1/3) e^(3x) * 2x dx
                              = (x^2 / 3) e^(3x) - (2/3) integral of x e^(3x) dx

Notice that the new integral — integral of x * e^(3x) dx — still has a polynomial times an exponential, but the power of x has gone down from 2 to 1. That's progress! But we're not done yet. We need to apply integration by parts again to this new integral.

[14:27:15] kthompson_2027: wait so i have to do integration by parts TWICE on this one? thats a lot of steps

[14:27:32] StudyBuddy: It is more steps, yes, but each application reduces the power of x by 1. That's the key idea: every time you apply integration by parts to a polynomial times an exponential, you knock the polynomial degree down by one.

- First application: x^2 became x (degree went from 2 to 1)
- Second application: x will become a constant (degree goes from 1 to 0)
- Once you have a constant times an exponential, that's a straightforward integral

So for integral of x^n * e^(ax) dx in general, you need to apply integration by parts n times. In our case n = 2, so twice.

Want to go ahead and do the second application? Set up u and dv for integral of x * e^(3x) dx.

[14:28:19] kthompson_2027: ok so for the second integral:

u = x         =>  du = dx
dv = e^(3x) dx  =>  v = (1/3) e^(3x)

so integral of x e^(3x) dx = x * (1/3) e^(3x) - integral of (1/3) e^(3x) dx
                             = (x/3) e^(3x) - (1/3) * (1/3) e^(3x) + C
                             = (x/3) e^(3x) - (1/9) e^(3x) + C

wait actually i think i messed up a sign somewhere. let me check.

hmm no that looks right. now i plug this back into the first expression?

[14:29:40] StudyBuddy: Your second application of integration by parts is correct! Let me check your work:

integral of x * e^(3x) dx = (x/3) e^(3x) - (1/9) e^(3x) + C

That's good. Now plug it back into the expression from the first application:

integral of x^2 e^(3x) dx = (x^2/3) e^(3x) - (2/3) * [ (x/3) e^(3x) - (1/9) e^(3x) ] + C

Let's distribute the -2/3:

= (x^2/3) e^(3x) - (2x/9) e^(3x) + (2/27) e^(3x) + C

We can factor out e^(3x):

= e^(3x) * [ x^2/3 - 2x/9 + 2/27 ] + C

To write it more neatly with a common denominator of 27:

= (e^(3x) / 27) * [ 9x^2 - 6x + 2 ] + C

Or equivalently:

= (1/27)(9x^2 - 6x + 2) e^(3x) + C

Does this match what you're getting?

[14:30:55] kthompson_2027: ok so i went back and actually tried doing all the algebra from scratch and i got something slightly different. let me show you what i did.

starting from:
integral x^2 e^(3x) dx = (x^2/3)e^(3x) - (2/3)[(x/3)e^(3x) - (1/9)e^(3x)]

i distributed the -2/3 and got:
= (x^2/3)e^(3x) - (2x/9)e^(3x) - (2/27)e^(3x)

wait, i wrote minus (2/27) instead of plus (2/27). is that right?

[14:31:28] StudyBuddy: I see the issue — you have a sign error in the distribution. Let me walk through it carefully:

The expression is:

  - (2/3) * [ (x/3)e^(3x) - (1/9)e^(3x) ]

Distribute the -(2/3):

  = -(2/3) * (x/3)e^(3x)  +  (2/3) * (1/9)e^(3x)

Notice the second term: -(2/3) times -(1/9) gives a positive (2/27). The negative in front of the bracket and the negative in front of the (1/9) term create a double negative, which becomes positive.

So the correct result is:

  = -(2x/9)e^(3x) + (2/27)e^(3x)

Your error was writing -(2/27) instead of +(2/27). You forgot to distribute the negative sign from outside the brackets through to the second term inside.

[14:32:15] kthompson_2027: oh i see the sign error now, i forgot to distribute the negative when i plugged back in

ok so the right answer is:

(1/27)(9x^2 - 6x + 2)e^(3x) + C

let me redo it from scratch to make sure...

[14:33:42] kthompson_2027: ok i just redid the whole thing and i get (1/27)(9x^2 - 6x + 2)e^(3x) + C.

[14:33:58] StudyBuddy: That's correct! Well done working through it again from the beginning. The final answer is:

  integral of x^2 e^(3x) dx = (1/27)(9x^2 - 6x + 2) e^(3x) + C

A few things to note about this problem:
1. You applied integration by parts twice because the polynomial x^2 had degree 2
2. Each application reduced the degree by 1
3. The most common error (which you caught!) is mishandling signs during substitution back

Would you like to try another problem from HW4?

[14:34:30] kthompson_2027: yeah! ok heres another one thats been bugging me:

integral of ln(x)^2 dx

does this also use integration by parts? theres no product of two different types of functions here, just (ln x) squared times... 1?

[14:34:58] StudyBuddy: Great observation — it does use integration by parts! Even though it doesn't look like a product at first glance, you can think of it as:

  (ln x)^2 * 1

So you're integrating (ln x)^2 times the function 1. Using the LIATE rule, logarithmic functions come first, so we set:

  u  = (ln x)^2     =>  du = 2 ln(x) * (1/x) dx = (2 ln x / x) dx
  dv = dx            =>  v  = x

Applying integration by parts:

  integral of (ln x)^2 dx = x (ln x)^2 - integral of x * (2 ln x / x) dx
                           = x (ln x)^2 - 2 * integral of ln(x) dx

Now we need integral of ln(x) dx, which itself requires integration by parts (setting u = ln x, dv = dx). Do you want to try that inner integral?

[14:35:52] kthompson_2027: sure. for integral of ln(x) dx:

u = ln(x)   =>  du = (1/x) dx
dv = dx      =>  v = x

so integral of ln(x) dx = x ln(x) - integral of x * (1/x) dx
                         = x ln(x) - integral of 1 dx
                         = x ln(x) - x + C

[14:36:14] StudyBuddy: Excellent — that's perfect! Now substitute back:

  integral of (ln x)^2 dx = x (ln x)^2 - 2 * [ x ln(x) - x ] + C
                           = x (ln x)^2 - 2x ln(x) + 2x + C

You can factor out x if you want:

  = x [ (ln x)^2 - 2 ln(x) + 2 ] + C

Both forms are acceptable for your homework. Notice the structure here is similar to the x^2 e^(3x) problem — each application of by parts reduces the "complexity" of the logarithmic part. The power of ln(x) went from 2 to 1 to 0.

[14:37:01] kthompson_2027: ok that actually makes a lot of sense. the pattern is the same — keep reducing the hard part until its easy.

let me try a few more from HW4 real quick and you can check my work?

[14:37:18] StudyBuddy: Absolutely — go ahead and work through them, and I'll check each step.

[14:37:45] kthompson_2027: ok problem 7.2.14: integral of x sin(2x) dx

u = x        =>  du = dx
dv = sin(2x) dx  =>  v = -(1/2)cos(2x)

integral = x * (-(1/2)cos(2x)) - integral of -(1/2)cos(2x) dx
         = -(x/2)cos(2x) + (1/2) integral of cos(2x) dx
         = -(x/2)cos(2x) + (1/2)(1/2)sin(2x) + C
         = -(x/2)cos(2x) + (1/4)sin(2x) + C

is that right?

[14:38:30] StudyBuddy: That's exactly right, well done! Let me verify each piece:

1. Your choices of u = x and dv = sin(2x) dx follow the LIATE rule (algebraic before trigonometric) — good.
2. v = -(1/2)cos(2x) — correct, the chain rule gives the 1/2 factor.
3. The by parts formula gives: -(x/2)cos(2x) + (1/2) integral of cos(2x) dx — you correctly handled the double negative.
4. integral of cos(2x) dx = (1/2)sin(2x) — correct.
5. Final answer: -(x/2)cos(2x) + (1/4)sin(2x) + C — correct.

That was clean work. Try the next one?

[14:39:12] kthompson_2027: ok heres 7.2.18: integral of x^2 cos(x) dx

this is gonna be two applications again right? because x^2 is degree 2

u = x^2       => du = 2x dx
dv = cos(x) dx => v = sin(x)

integral = x^2 sin(x) - integral of 2x sin(x) dx
         = x^2 sin(x) - 2 integral of x sin(x) dx

now for integral of x sin(x) dx:
u = x        => du = dx
dv = sin(x) dx => v = -cos(x)

= x(-cos(x)) - integral of (-cos(x)) dx
= -x cos(x) + integral of cos(x) dx
= -x cos(x) + sin(x) + C

so plugging back:
integral of x^2 cos(x) dx = x^2 sin(x) - 2[-x cos(x) + sin(x)] + C
                            = x^2 sin(x) + 2x cos(x) - 2 sin(x) + C

[14:40:48] StudyBuddy: Outstanding! Every step checks out:

1. First by parts: u = x^2, dv = cos(x) dx — reduces to integral of x sin(x) dx. Correct.
2. Second by parts: u = x, dv = sin(x) dx — gives -x cos(x) + sin(x). Correct.
3. Substitution back: distributed the -2 correctly through both terms. Correct.

Final answer: x^2 sin(x) + 2x cos(x) - 2 sin(x) + C

You can verify by differentiating — if you take the derivative of this expression, you should get x^2 cos(x) back. That's always a good check on exams.

Notice you didn't make the sign error this time — distributing that -2 correctly through the brackets. You're improving with practice.

[14:41:30] kthompson_2027: ok one more. 7.2.22: integral of e^x sin(x) dx

this one is different right? neither part is a polynomial so you cant just keep reducing the degree. how does by parts even help here?

[14:42:00] StudyBuddy: Great question — this is the special case where neither function simplifies by differentiation. With e^x * sin(x), if you differentiate either one, you just get another function of the same type.

The trick here is to apply integration by parts twice and then solve for the original integral algebraically. Here's the strategy:

Let I = integral of e^x sin(x) dx

First application:
  u  = sin(x)    =>  du = cos(x) dx
  dv = e^x dx    =>  v  = e^x

  I = e^x sin(x) - integral of e^x cos(x) dx

Now apply by parts to integral of e^x cos(x) dx:
  u  = cos(x)    =>  du = -sin(x) dx
  dv = e^x dx    =>  v  = e^x

  integral of e^x cos(x) dx = e^x cos(x) - integral of e^x (-sin(x)) dx
                              = e^x cos(x) + integral of e^x sin(x) dx
                              = e^x cos(x) + I

Substituting back:
  I = e^x sin(x) - [ e^x cos(x) + I ]
  I = e^x sin(x) - e^x cos(x) - I
  2I = e^x sin(x) - e^x cos(x)
  I = (1/2) e^x [ sin(x) - cos(x) ] + C

Try working through it on your own and see if you get the same thing.

[14:43:25] kthompson_2027: oh wow thats actually really clever. so you do by parts twice and the original integral shows up on the right side so you can just solve for it like an algebra equation. let me try it myself...

[14:45:18] kthompson_2027: ok i got:

I = e^x sin(x) - e^x cos(x) - I
2I = e^x(sin(x) - cos(x))
I = (1/2)e^x(sin(x) - cos(x)) + C

same answer!

[14:45:35] StudyBuddy: That's exactly right. This "circular" integration by parts technique works whenever you have e^(ax) times sin(bx) or cos(bx). After two applications, the original integral reappears on the other side, and you just solve for it.

You should remember this pattern for your homework and for exams — Prof. Adebayo may test it since it's a common problem type in Calculus II.

[14:46:01] kthompson_2027: hey can i ask about something else? my prof said tabular method is fine as long as we show we understand the underlying technique. whats the tabular method exactly? some people in my class use it and it seems way faster

[14:46:22] StudyBuddy: Tabular integration (sometimes called the "tabular method" or "tic-tac-toe method") is a shortcut for repeated integration by parts, and it works particularly well when one factor is a polynomial (since its derivatives eventually become zero).

Here's how it works:

1. Write two columns. In the left column, repeatedly differentiate u (the polynomial part). In the right column, repeatedly integrate dv (the other part).

2. Draw diagonal arrows from each entry in the left column to the next entry down in the right column.

3. Alternate signs: +, -, +, -, ... on each diagonal arrow.

4. Multiply along each diagonal and add up the results.

For example, for integral of x^2 * e^(3x) dx:

Left column (derivatives of x^2):    Right column (integrals of e^(3x)):
  x^2                                  e^(3x)
  2x                                   (1/3)e^(3x)
  2                                    (1/9)e^(3x)
  0                                    (1/27)e^(3x)

Diagonals with alternating signs:
  + x^2 * (1/3)e^(3x)    =  (x^2/3) e^(3x)
  - 2x  * (1/9)e^(3x)    = -(2x/9) e^(3x)
  + 2   * (1/27)e^(3x)   =  (2/27) e^(3x)

Sum: (x^2/3 - 2x/9 + 2/27) e^(3x) + C = (1/27)(9x^2 - 6x + 2) e^(3x) + C

Same answer as before, but much faster — no need to write out the full by parts formula twice.

The tabular method works for products of the form (polynomial) times (exponential or trig), where the polynomial eventually differentiates to zero. It does NOT work for cases like e^x sin(x) where neither factor eventually becomes zero.

Since Prof. Adebayo is fine with it as long as you understand the underlying technique, I'd recommend using it on your homework for polynomial-times-exponential or polynomial-times-trig integrals to save time, but be prepared to show the full by parts method if asked on an exam.

[14:48:10] kthompson_2027: oh thats so much cleaner. so it only works when one of the pieces will eventually differentiate down to zero? like a polynomial?

[14:48:28] StudyBuddy: Exactly. The method terminates when one column reaches zero. Since polynomials differentiate down to zero after finitely many steps, they're the natural candidate for the left column.

Functions that don't differentiate to zero — like sin(x), cos(x), e^x, ln(x) — would produce an infinite table, so the tabular method doesn't apply in the simple way. (There is an extended version for the e^x sin(x) type, but it's more complicated and not always taught in Calc II courses.)

For your HW4 problems 7.2.11 through 7.2.38, I'd guess maybe 60-70% of them are polynomial-times-exponential or polynomial-times-trig, so the tabular method will save you a lot of writing on those.

[14:49:03] kthompson_2027: ok sweet. so just to make sure i have this all down:

1. LIATE rule for choosing u and dv
2. each by-parts application reduces the degree of the polynomial by 1
3. for polynomial * exp or polynomial * trig, use tabular method as shortcut
4. for exp * trig, do by parts twice and solve for the original integral
5. for (ln x)^n, set u = (ln x)^n and dv = dx, reduce the power each time

[14:49:35] StudyBuddy: That's an excellent summary! You've captured all the major strategies for integration by parts problems in section 7.2. Let me add one small note:

For strategy 5, the same applies to inverse trig functions — for example, integral of arctan(x) dx uses u = arctan(x), dv = dx. Inverse trig and log functions are high on the LIATE list precisely because they become simpler when differentiated.

One exam tip: always check your answer by differentiating. If you differentiate your result and get back the original integrand, you know you're correct. This is especially useful for catching sign errors, which were your most common mistake type today.

[14:50:12] kthompson_2027: yeah i noticed that too, i made like 3 sign errors during this session. i need to be more careful when distributing negatives.

[14:50:30] StudyBuddy: That's a very common thing, especially with nested integration by parts where you're substituting one result back into another. Three arithmetic or sign errors during a practice session is completely normal — the important thing is that you caught all three after I pointed them out, and you were able to self-correct each time. That's how the learning process works.

Here are some strategies to reduce sign errors:

1. Write out every intermediate step rather than doing arithmetic in your head
2. Circle or highlight negative signs so they don't get lost
3. After each by parts application, verify the sign by checking a specific value (like x = 0 or x = 1)
4. Use the tabular method when possible, since the alternating sign pattern is built into the method

[14:51:15] kthompson_2027: thanks this actually makes way more sense now, im gonna try 7.2.22 thru 7.2.30 on my own

[14:51:30] StudyBuddy: Sounds like a great plan! You've got a solid understanding of all the major techniques now. Here are my suggestions as you work through those problems:

- Start each problem by identifying the integrand type (polynomial*exp, polynomial*trig, exp*trig, log, etc.)
- Choose your strategy before computing anything
- Use the tabular method for polynomial products to save time
- Check at least a couple answers by differentiating

If you get stuck on any of them, feel free to open another session. Good luck with the rest of HW4, and I hope Prof. Adebayo's class goes well!

[14:51:58] kthompson_2027: thanks!! this was super helpful. definitely my best tutoring session so far

[14:52:05] StudyBuddy: You're welcome! You're making great progress — this is only your third session on StudyBuddy and you've already come a long way from limits and derivatives to integration by parts. Keep up the great work!

APPENDIX — WORKED SOLUTIONS FROM SESSION
-----------------------------------------

PROBLEM 1: integral of x^2 e^(3x) dx

Setup:
  u  = x^2          du = 2x dx
  dv = e^(3x) dx    v  = (1/3) e^(3x)

First application:
  = (x^2/3) e^(3x) - (2/3) integral of x e^(3x) dx

Second application (on the remaining integral):
  u  = x             du = dx
  dv = e^(3x) dx     v  = (1/3) e^(3x)

  integral of x e^(3x) dx = (x/3) e^(3x) - (1/9) e^(3x)

Substitution:
  = (x^2/3) e^(3x) - (2/3)[(x/3) e^(3x) - (1/9) e^(3x)]
  = (x^2/3) e^(3x) - (2x/9) e^(3x) + (2/27) e^(3x)

Note: student initially wrote -(2/27) instead of +(2/27) due to sign distribution error.
Correct factored form: (1/27)(9x^2 - 6x + 2) e^(3x) + C

PROBLEM 2: integral of (ln x)^2 dx

Setup:
  u  = (ln x)^2     du = 2 ln(x) / x dx
  dv = dx            v  = x

First application:
  = x (ln x)^2 - 2 integral of ln(x) dx

Inner integral (integral of ln(x) dx):
  u  = ln(x)    du = (1/x) dx
  dv = dx        v  = x

  = x ln(x) - integral of 1 dx = x ln(x) - x

Final:
  = x (ln x)^2 - 2[x ln(x) - x] + C
  = x (ln x)^2 - 2x ln(x) + 2x + C
  = x[(ln x)^2 - 2 ln(x) + 2] + C

PROBLEM 3: integral of x sin(2x) dx  [problem 7.2.14]

  u  = x              du = dx
  dv = sin(2x) dx     v  = -(1/2) cos(2x)

  = -(x/2) cos(2x) + (1/2) integral of cos(2x) dx
  = -(x/2) cos(2x) + (1/4) sin(2x) + C

Student computed this correctly with no errors.

PROBLEM 4: integral of x^2 cos(x) dx  [problem 7.2.18]

First application:
  u  = x^2          du = 2x dx
  dv = cos(x) dx    v  = sin(x)

  = x^2 sin(x) - 2 integral of x sin(x) dx

Second application:
  u  = x             du = dx
  dv = sin(x) dx     v  = -cos(x)

  integral of x sin(x) dx = -x cos(x) + sin(x)

Substitution:
  = x^2 sin(x) - 2[-x cos(x) + sin(x)] + C
  = x^2 sin(x) + 2x cos(x) - 2 sin(x) + C

Student computed this correctly with no errors.

PROBLEM 5: integral of e^x sin(x) dx  [problem 7.2.22 — started in session, to be completed independently]

Circular integration by parts:
  I = integral of e^x sin(x) dx

  First application: I = e^x sin(x) - integral of e^x cos(x) dx
  Second application: integral of e^x cos(x) dx = e^x cos(x) + I

  Solving: I = e^x sin(x) - e^x cos(x) - I
           2I = e^x(sin(x) - cos(x))
           I = (1/2) e^x (sin(x) - cos(x)) + C

-----------------------------------------

TABULAR METHOD OVERVIEW (discussed in session):

For integral of x^2 * e^(3x) dx:

Derivatives of x^2  |  Integrals of e^(3x)  |  Sign
--------------------|----------------------|------
x^2                 |  e^(3x)              |  +
2x                  |  (1/3)e^(3x)         |  -
2                   |  (1/9)e^(3x)         |  +
0                   |  (1/27)e^(3x)        |  (stop)

Result: + x^2 * (1/3)e^(3x) - 2x * (1/9)e^(3x) + 2 * (1/27)e^(3x) + C
      = (1/27)(9x^2 - 6x + 2) e^(3x) + C

Works for: polynomial * exponential, polynomial * trig
Does NOT work for: exponential * trig (neither column terminates)

-----------------------------------------

LIATE RULE REFERENCE:

L — Logarithmic (ln x, log x)
I — Inverse Trig (arctan x, arcsin x)
A — Algebraic (x, x^2, polynomials)
T — Trigonometric (sin x, cos x)
E — Exponential (e^x, 2^x)

Choose u from whichever category is highest (earliest in LIATE).
Set dv = everything else.

Rationale: functions higher in the list simplify when differentiated;
functions lower in the list are easy to integrate.

Session 3: MATH 221 — Integration by parts (this session)

Strengths observed:
- Correct application of LIATE rule after initial explanation
- Successfully computed all five integrals with guidance
- Self-corrected all errors once identified
- Able to articulate the pattern (reducing polynomial degree)

Areas for improvement:
- Sign errors during distribution (3 instances this session)
- Should verify answers by differentiation as a habit
- Needs practice with the circular by parts technique (exp * trig)

Recommended next topics:
- Trigonometric integrals (section 7.3)
- Trigonometric substitution (section 7.4)
- Partial fractions (section 7.5)
