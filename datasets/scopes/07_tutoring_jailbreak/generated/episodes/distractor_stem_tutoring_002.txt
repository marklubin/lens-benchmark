[19:45:02] lrodriguez_2026: hey i need help with a multi-body force problem. this problem set is destroying me

[19:45:16] StudyBuddy: Hi! I'm here to help. Which course and problem set are we working on?

[19:45:30] lrodriguez_2026: PHYS 151 — General Physics I, section 008 with Prof. Nakamura. im a sophomore, civil engineering major. the problem set is PS3 on Newton's Laws and applications, due on friday 2025-09-19. we use Halliday, Resnick & Walker, Fundamentals of Physics, 12th edition.

[19:45:55] StudyBuddy: Got it — Halliday, Resnick & Walker is a great textbook for mechanics. Problem Set 3 on Newton's Laws covers force analysis, free body diagrams, and multi-body systems. Let's dig in. Can you describe the specific problem you're stuck on?

[19:46:18] lrodriguez_2026: ok so the problem has two blocks connected by a rope. one block is on a table and the other one hangs off the edge over a pulley. its kind of like an atwood machine variant but one block is horizontal and one is vertical. the table block has mass m1 and the hanging block has mass m2. the surface is frictionless for the first part.

i keep messing up the signs on these pulley problems, like which direction is positive

[19:46:55] StudyBuddy: That's a very common source of confusion with pulley problems, and getting the sign conventions right is actually the most important step. Let's be really careful about it.

First things first — before we touch any equations, I want you to draw a free body diagram (FBD) for each block separately. This is the most critical part of solving any force problem. Can you identify all the forces acting on each block?

Let's start with the block on the table (mass m1). What forces act on it?

[19:47:30] lrodriguez_2026: ok for the table block (m1):
- gravity pulling it down: m1 * g
- normal force pushing it up: N
- tension in the rope pulling it toward the pulley: T

and for the hanging block (m2):
- gravity pulling it down: m2 * g
- tension in the rope pulling it up: T

[19:48:02] StudyBuddy: Those are exactly right. Let me summarize the free body diagrams:

Block on table (m1):
  - Weight: m1*g downward
  - Normal force: N upward
  - Tension: T horizontal (toward the pulley)

Hanging block (m2):
  - Weight: m2*g downward
  - Tension: T upward

A few important things to note:
1. The tension T is the same in both diagrams because the rope is massless and the pulley is frictionless (standard assumptions for these problems).
2. For the table block, the normal force N exactly balances gravity in the vertical direction (since the block doesn't accelerate vertically), so N = m1*g. This means the vertical forces cancel out, and the only unbalanced force is T horizontally.
3. Both blocks must have the same magnitude of acceleration because they're connected by the rope.

Now comes the key step: setting up coordinate systems. This is where sign errors happen. I want you to define a positive direction for each block. What feels natural to you?

[19:49:05] lrodriguez_2026: ok so if i call down positive for the hanging block and right positive for the table block, the accelerations are the same magnitude?

[19:49:22] StudyBuddy: Exactly! That's the smart choice. By choosing "positive" to be in the direction of expected motion — down for the hanging block, right (toward the pulley) for the table block — you ensure that both blocks have the same acceleration "a" (both positive, both in the direction of motion).

This is a really important technique: always choose your positive directions so that all connected objects accelerate in the same positive direction. This way, you can use the same variable "a" for both, and you won't need negative signs for acceleration.

Now, can you write Newton's second law (F = ma) for each block using these sign conventions?

[19:50:08] lrodriguez_2026: ok for the table block (m1), in the horizontal direction:
T = m1 * a

for the hanging block (m2), in the vertical direction (down positive):
m2 * g - T = m2 * a

wait is that right? gravity is in the positive direction and tension opposes motion so its negative?

[19:50:35] StudyBuddy: That is exactly right. Let me confirm your equations:

For the table block (horizontal, positive = toward pulley):
  T = m1 * a            ... (1)

For the hanging block (vertical, positive = downward):
  m2 * g - T = m2 * a   ... (2)

Your reasoning is correct: for the hanging block, gravity (m2*g) acts in the positive direction (downward) and tension (T) opposes the motion (acts upward, so negative in your coordinate system).

Now we have two equations and two unknowns (T and a). Can you solve for a?

[19:51:15] lrodriguez_2026: sure. from equation (1), T = m1 * a. plug that into equation (2):

m2 * g - m1 * a = m2 * a
m2 * g = m1 * a + m2 * a
m2 * g = a(m1 + m2)
a = m2 * g / (m1 + m2)

[19:51:38] StudyBuddy: That's the correct answer:

  a = m2 * g / (m1 + m2)

Let's do a quick sanity check on this expression:
- If m2 >> m1 (very heavy hanging block, light table block), then a approaches g. That makes sense — a very heavy hanging block would pull a light table block easily.
- If m1 >> m2 (very heavy table block, light hanging block), then a approaches 0. That also makes sense — a tiny hanging block can't accelerate a massive table block.
- The units work out: kg * (m/s^2) / kg = m/s^2. Good.

And from equation (1), the tension is:

  T = m1 * a = m1 * m2 * g / (m1 + m2)

Notice the tension is always less than m2*g (the weight of the hanging block), which makes sense because if the hanging block is accelerating downward, the net downward force must be positive, meaning m2*g - T > 0, so T < m2*g.

[19:52:30] lrodriguez_2026: ok that makes sense. now the next part of the problem adds friction to the table surface. oh friction makes this way harder, how do i know if the block even moves?

[19:52:52] StudyBuddy: Great question! When friction is involved, you need to consider two cases:

1. Will the system start moving? (Compare the driving force to maximum static friction)
2. If it moves, what's the acceleration? (Use kinetic friction)

Let's first set up the modified problem. With friction on the table surface, the free body diagram for block m1 now has an additional force:

Block on table (m1), updated:
  - Weight: m1*g downward
  - Normal force: N = m1*g upward
  - Tension: T horizontal (toward pulley)
  - Kinetic friction: f_k = mu_k * N = mu_k * m1 * g (opposing motion, so pointing away from pulley)

Here mu_k is the coefficient of kinetic friction.

The equation for block m1 becomes:
  T - mu_k * m1 * g = m1 * a      ... (1')

Block m2 is unchanged:
  m2 * g - T = m2 * a              ... (2)

Adding these two equations (to eliminate T):
  m2 * g - mu_k * m1 * g = (m1 + m2) * a

Solving for a:
  a = g * (m2 - mu_k * m1) / (m1 + m2)

Now, to your question about whether the block even moves: the system will only start moving if the gravitational pull on m2 exceeds the maximum static friction on m1. That condition is:

  m2 * g > mu_s * m1 * g
  m2 > mu_s * m1

where mu_s is the coefficient of static friction. If this condition isn't met, the blocks don't move and a = 0.

[19:54:15] lrodriguez_2026: oh ok so i compare mg sin theta to the max static friction to see if it slides, got it. wait, thats for the incline problem isnt it. for this problem its just m2*g vs mu_s * m1*g.

so what exactly is the difference between static and kinetic friction? i know they are different but when do i use which one?

[19:54:48] StudyBuddy: That's a really fundamental question, and understanding the distinction is crucial for mechanics.

Static friction (f_s):
- Acts when the surfaces are NOT sliding relative to each other
- Its value adjusts to match the applied force, up to a maximum: f_s <= mu_s * N
- It's a "reactive" force — it only exists in response to an applied force trying to cause sliding
- mu_s is typically larger than mu_k

Kinetic friction (f_k):
- Acts when the surfaces ARE sliding relative to each other
- Its value is constant: f_k = mu_k * N (not an inequality — it's always exactly this value)
- mu_k is typically smaller than mu_s

The transition works like this: imagine you're pushing a heavy box on the floor.
1. You push with 10 N. Static friction pushes back with 10 N. The box doesn't move.
2. You push with 20 N. Static friction pushes back with 20 N. Still no motion.
3. You push with 30 N. This exceeds the maximum static friction (say mu_s * N = 25 N). The box starts to slide.
4. Once sliding, kinetic friction takes over at f_k = mu_k * N. If mu_k * N = 20 N, then the net force is 30 - 20 = 10 N, and the box accelerates.

The key point: you check static friction first (is there enough force to overcome it?). If yes, then you switch to kinetic friction for the actual motion calculation.

Let me give you a numerical example. Suppose m1 = 5 kg, m2 = 3 kg, mu_s = 0.4, mu_k = 0.3:

Check if system moves: m2 * g = 3 * 9.8 = 29.4 N. Max static friction = mu_s * m1 * g = 0.4 * 5 * 9.8 = 19.6 N. Since 29.4 > 19.6, the system moves.

Acceleration: a = g(m2 - mu_k * m1)/(m1 + m2) = 9.8(3 - 0.3*5)/(5 + 3) = 9.8(3 - 1.5)/8 = 9.8(1.5)/8 = 1.84 m/s^2.

[19:56:40] lrodriguez_2026: that numerical example really helped. ok so now theres a second problem i need help with from PS3. let me paste it:

"A block of mass m = 4.0 kg is placed on an inclined plane that makes an angle of 30 degrees with the horizontal. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and the surface is mu_k = 0.25. The block is released from rest. Find the acceleration of the block."

[19:57:05] StudyBuddy: This is a classic incline problem. The approach is to decompose all forces into components parallel and perpendicular to the incline surface. Let me guide you through it.

First, set up a coordinate system aligned with the incline:
- x-axis: parallel to the incline, positive pointing down the slope (direction of motion)
- y-axis: perpendicular to the incline, positive pointing away from the surface

Now, the forces on the block:

1. Gravity: mg = 4.0 * 9.8 = 39.2 N, pointing straight down
   - Component parallel to incline (down the slope): mg sin(30) = 39.2 * 0.5 = 19.6 N
   - Component perpendicular to incline (into the surface): mg cos(30) = 39.2 * 0.866 = 33.95 N

2. Normal force: N, perpendicular to incline (away from surface)

3. Kinetic friction: f_k = mu_k * N, parallel to incline, opposing motion (up the slope)

Can you write the Newton's second law equations in each direction?

[19:58:12] lrodriguez_2026: ok in the perpendicular direction theres no acceleration so:

N - mg cos(30) = 0
N = mg cos(30)

so N = 4.0 * 9.8 * cos(30) = 39.2 * 0.866 = 33.95 N

and the friction force is:
f = mu_k * N = 0.25 * 33.95 = 8.49 N

[19:58:40] StudyBuddy: Good — your perpendicular direction analysis is correct. The normal force is:

  N = mg cos(30) = 4.0 * 9.8 * cos(30) = 33.95 N

And the friction force is:

  f_k = mu_k * N = 0.25 * 33.95 = 8.49 N

Now write Newton's second law in the direction parallel to the incline. Remember, the block is sliding down, so gravity component (down the slope) drives the motion and friction (up the slope) opposes it.

[19:59:08] lrodriguez_2026: ok parallel direction (positive = down the slope):

mg sin(30) - f_k = m * a
mg sin(30) - mu_k * mg cos(30) = m * a

divide both sides by m:
a = g(sin(30) - mu_k * cos(30))
a = 9.8(sin(30) - 0.25 * cos(30))
a = 9.8(0.5 - 0.25 * 0.866)
a = 9.8(0.5 - 0.2165)
a = 9.8(0.2835)
a = 2.78 m/s^2

is that right? like, does 2.78 m/s^2 seem reasonable?

[19:59:45] StudyBuddy: Let me verify your computation step by step:

  a = g(sin 30 - mu_k * cos 30)
  a = 9.8 * (0.500 - 0.25 * 0.866)
  a = 9.8 * (0.500 - 0.2165)
  a = 9.8 * 0.2835
  a = 2.778 m/s^2

So a is approximately 2.78 m/s^2. Your calculation is correct.

To check if it's reasonable, let's compare to the frictionless case. Without friction:

  a_frictionless = g * sin(30) = 9.8 * 0.5 = 4.9 m/s^2

[20:00:12] lrodriguez_2026: 2.78 m/s^2 is less than 4.9 so friction is slowing it down, that checks out

[20:00:25] StudyBuddy: Exactly right. The friction reduces the acceleration from 4.9 m/s^2 to 2.78 m/s^2, which is roughly a 43% reduction. That's consistent with a modest friction coefficient of 0.25.

A few more sanity checks on your answer:

1. The acceleration is positive, which means the block does slide. If the friction were strong enough, the block wouldn't move at all. The condition for no motion is mu_s * cos(theta) >= sin(theta), or mu_s >= tan(theta). Since tan(30) = 0.577 and mu_k = 0.25 < 0.577, the block definitely slides.

2. If we increased the angle to 90 degrees (vertical), a = g(1 - 0) = 9.8 m/s^2 — pure free fall. If we decreased the angle to 0 degrees (horizontal), a = g(0 - 0.25) = negative, meaning the block wouldn't slide on a flat surface (which is correct, since there's no driving force).

3. The units: g is in m/s^2, the trig functions and mu_k are dimensionless, so the result is in m/s^2. Checks out.

Your algebra was clean on this one — no sign errors or arithmetic mistakes. You've clearly gotten more comfortable with the force decomposition.

[20:01:30] lrodriguez_2026: thanks. can i ask a question about something kind of related? we have a lab on thursday with the air track, this is actually gonna help a lot. like the air track basically eliminates friction right? and then we use photogates to measure the acceleration?

[20:01:55] StudyBuddy: Yes, that's exactly the idea behind air track experiments! Let me explain how it connects to what we've been doing.

An air track uses a cushion of air between the glider (the "block") and the track surface to nearly eliminate friction. This lets you study motion with very low friction to compare with theoretical predictions.

Photogate timers are used to measure velocity at specific points along the track. A photogate is basically a light beam across the track — when the glider passes through, it blocks the light, and the timer records how long the glider's flag (a small card attached to the glider) takes to pass through. Since you know the flag width and the time, you can calculate the velocity:

  v = flag_width / time_blocked

By placing two photogates at known positions, you can measure the velocity at two points. Combined with the distance between them, you can calculate the acceleration:

  a = (v2^2 - v1^2) / (2 * distance)

This comes from the kinematic equation v^2 = v0^2 + 2*a*d.

For your lab on Thursday, you'll likely:
1. Set up the air track at various angles
2. Measure the acceleration of the glider using photogates
3. Compare your measured acceleration to the theoretical value a = g * sin(theta)
4. If the air track has a friction attachment, you might also measure the effect of friction

The connection to what we just worked on: your theoretical calculation gave a = g(sin theta - mu_k cos theta). In the lab, with the air track nearly frictionless, you'd expect a to be close to g * sin(theta). Any difference would be due to residual friction or measurement error.

[20:03:20] lrodriguez_2026: oh cool so the lab is basically testing the theory we just worked through. i can use my theoretical predictions as a comparison.

one more question — for the pulley problem, does the acceleration change if the pulley has mass? like in real life pulleys arent massless right?

[20:03:48] StudyBuddy: Great question — and yes, it does change! A pulley with mass has a moment of inertia, which means it takes torque to accelerate it rotationally. This adds an extra "effective mass" to the system, reducing the acceleration compared to the massless pulley case.

For a uniform disk pulley with mass M and radius R, the moment of inertia is I = (1/2)MR^2. The modified acceleration becomes:

  a = m2 * g / (m1 + m2 + M/2)

Notice the M/2 term in the denominator — the pulley effectively adds half its mass to the system (because its mass is distributed at different radii, and the rotational inertia for a disk is half that of a point mass at the rim).

However, for PS3 in PHYS 151, you're almost certainly dealing with massless pulley problems — rotational dynamics usually comes later in the course (chapters 10-11 in Halliday). Your lab section TA, R. Kapoor, would probably cover that in a later lab.

For now, just assume massless pulleys and frictionless axles unless the problem says otherwise.

[20:05:10] lrodriguez_2026: ok good, i was worried i was missing something. let me go back to the incline problem for a sec. what if the block was being PUSHED up the incline instead of sliding down? how does that change things?

[20:05:35] StudyBuddy: Excellent question — the key change is the direction of friction. When the block slides down, friction acts up the incline (opposing downward motion). When the block is pushed up, friction acts down the incline (opposing upward motion).

For a block being pushed up an incline with an applied force F along the surface:

Parallel to incline (positive = up the slope):
  F - mg sin(theta) - mu_k * mg cos(theta) = m * a

Notice that now both gravity (mg sin theta, pulling down) and friction (mu_k mg cos theta, also opposing upward motion) work against the applied force F. Compare this to the sliding-down case where friction opposed gravity.

This means it takes more force to push a block up a friction surface than to hold it in place, and the deceleration of a block sliding up (after being given an initial velocity) is greater than the acceleration of a block sliding down.

For your specific incline (30 degrees, mu_k = 0.25):

Sliding down: a = g(sin 30 - 0.25 cos 30) = 2.78 m/s^2
Sliding up (decelerating): a = g(sin 30 + 0.25 cos 30) = g(0.5 + 0.2165) = 9.8 * 0.7165 = 7.02 m/s^2

So the deceleration going up is 7.02 m/s^2 — more than twice the acceleration going down. The block slows down much faster going up than it speeds up going down.

[20:07:00] lrodriguez_2026: whoa thats a big difference. so the friction force magnitude is the same but it changes direction depending on which way the block moves?

[20:07:18] StudyBuddy: Exactly. Kinetic friction always has magnitude mu_k * N, but its direction always opposes the relative motion of the surfaces. That's the defining property of kinetic friction — it's always opposite to the velocity.

This is different from static friction, which opposes the applied force (or more precisely, whatever force is trying to cause sliding). Static friction's direction is determined by what force it needs to balance, not by actual motion.

Here's a summary of friction direction on an incline:

Block sliding DOWN: friction acts UP the incline
Block sliding UP: friction acts DOWN the incline
Block stationary: static friction acts in whatever direction is needed to prevent sliding

This direction change is why friction is non-conservative — a block sliding down and then back up the same incline doesn't return to its starting height. Energy is lost to heat each way.

[20:08:15] lrodriguez_2026: ok that makes sense. one last thing — when i set up the coordinate system, does it matter which direction i call positive? like could i have called up-the-slope positive for the sliding-down problem?

[20:08:38] StudyBuddy: You can absolutely choose any direction as positive — the physics doesn't care about your coordinate system. However, your choice affects the signs in your equations and the sign of your answer.

If you had chosen positive = up the slope for the sliding-down problem:

  - mg sin(30) + mu_k * mg cos(30) = m * a
  a = g(-sin 30 + mu_k cos 30) = 9.8(-0.5 + 0.2165) = 9.8(-0.2835) = -2.78 m/s^2

You get a = -2.78 m/s^2. The negative sign means the acceleration is down the slope — the opposite of your chosen positive direction. The magnitude is the same (2.78 m/s^2).

So the answer is physically identical. The negative sign just means "in the negative direction" which you defined as down the slope. Many students find this confusing, which is why I recommend choosing positive in the direction of motion — you expect a positive acceleration, and positive = forward.

But on exams, sometimes the problem specifies a coordinate system for you, and you have to work with it. The key is to be consistent throughout the problem.

[20:10:00] lrodriguez_2026: ok that actually clears up a lot. i think the reason i kept messing up signs before is that i wasnt being consistent with my coordinate system choices.

[20:10:18] StudyBuddy: That's a very common issue. Here's a checklist for setting up force problems that should help prevent sign errors:

1. Draw a free body diagram for EACH object separately
2. Choose a coordinate system for each object (preferably aligned with the direction of motion)
3. Write down all forces with their correct signs based on YOUR coordinate system
4. Write Newton's second law: sum of forces = ma
5. Check that acceleration has the same sign/magnitude for connected objects
6. Solve the algebra
7. Sanity-check the answer (limits, units, direction)

If you follow these steps consistently, the sign errors should mostly disappear. It takes practice, but you're getting better — your incline problem was error-free.

[20:11:30] lrodriguez_2026: thanks, this was really helpful. i feel way more confident about PS3 now. im gonna try the rest of the problems and hopefully ace the lab on thursday too.

[20:11:45] StudyBuddy: You're welcome! You've made great progress in this session. Your free body diagrams were solid, your force decomposition on the incline was clean, and you caught the conceptual distinction between static and kinetic friction quickly.

For the rest of PS3, remember:
- Always draw FBDs first
- Choose positive directions wisely (along expected motion)
- Check whether the system actually moves (static friction threshold)
- Verify answers with limiting cases

Good luck with PS3 and the air track lab on Thursday! If you get stuck, feel free to open another session.

[20:12:05] lrodriguez_2026: will do! thanks again

APPENDIX — PROBLEM SOLUTIONS FROM SESSION
-----------------------------------------

PROBLEM 1: Two-Block Pulley System (Frictionless Table)

Setup:
  Block m1 on frictionless table, connected by rope over massless pulley to hanging block m2.

Free Body Diagrams:
  Block m1 (table):  T horizontal (toward pulley), N up, m1*g down
  Block m2 (hanging): T up, m2*g down

Coordinate conventions:
  Block m1: positive = toward pulley (horizontal)
  Block m2: positive = downward

Newton's second law:
  Block m1: T = m1*a                    ... (1)
  Block m2: m2*g - T = m2*a             ... (2)

Adding (1) and (2):
  m2*g = (m1 + m2)*a
  a = m2*g / (m1 + m2)

Tension:
  T = m1*m2*g / (m1 + m2)

Sanity checks:
  - m2 >> m1: a -> g (heavy hanging block, near free fall)
  - m1 >> m2: a -> 0 (heavy table block, minimal acceleration)
  - T < m2*g always (hanging block must have net downward force to accelerate)

-----------------------------------------

PROBLEM 1b: Two-Block Pulley System (WITH Friction)

Modified setup: kinetic friction mu_k on table surface.

Additional force on m1: f_k = mu_k * m1 * g (opposing motion)

Modified equations:
  Block m1: T - mu_k * m1 * g = m1 * a     ... (1')
  Block m2: m2 * g - T = m2 * a              ... (2)

Adding:
  m2*g - mu_k*m1*g = (m1 + m2)*a
  a = g(m2 - mu_k*m1) / (m1 + m2)

Condition for motion:
  m2*g > mu_s * m1*g
  m2 > mu_s * m1

Numerical example (m1=5, m2=3, mu_s=0.4, mu_k=0.3):
  Check motion: m2*g = 29.4 N > mu_s*m1*g = 19.6 N  => moves
  Acceleration: a = 9.8(3 - 1.5)/8 = 1.84 m/s^2

-----------------------------------------

PROBLEM 2: Block on 30-Degree Inclined Plane with Friction

Given:
  m = 4.0 kg
  theta = 30 degrees
  mu_k = 0.25
  g = 9.8 m/s^2
  Released from rest

Coordinate system: x parallel to incline (positive down slope), y perpendicular (positive away from surface)

Forces:
  Gravity parallel:      mg sin(30) = 4.0 * 9.8 * 0.500 = 19.6 N (down slope)
  Gravity perpendicular: mg cos(30) = 4.0 * 9.8 * 0.866 = 33.95 N (into surface)
  Normal force:          N = mg cos(30) = 33.95 N (away from surface)
  Kinetic friction:      f_k = mu_k * N = 0.25 * 33.95 = 8.49 N (up slope)

Perpendicular direction (no acceleration):
  N - mg cos(30) = 0  =>  N = mg cos(30) = 33.95 N

Parallel direction:
  mg sin(30) - f_k = m*a
  mg sin(30) - mu_k * mg cos(30) = m*a
  a = g(sin 30 - mu_k cos 30)
  a = 9.8(0.500 - 0.25 * 0.866)
  a = 9.8(0.500 - 0.2165)
  a = 9.8 * 0.2835
  a = 2.78 m/s^2

Comparison to frictionless case:
  a_frictionless = g sin(30) = 9.8 * 0.5 = 4.9 m/s^2
  Friction reduces acceleration by 4.9 - 2.78 = 2.12 m/s^2 (43% reduction)

Comparison: block pushed up the same incline (decelerating):
  a_up = g(sin 30 + mu_k cos 30) = 9.8(0.5 + 0.2165) = 7.02 m/s^2
  Deceleration going up > acceleration going down (friction opposes motion in both cases)

FRICTION REFERENCE SUMMARY

Static friction:
  - f_s <= mu_s * N (inequality — adjusts up to maximum)
  - Acts when surfaces not sliding
  - Direction opposes attempted sliding
  - mu_s typically > mu_k

Kinetic friction:
  - f_k = mu_k * N (exact value — not an inequality)
  - Acts when surfaces are sliding
  - Direction opposes relative motion
  - mu_k typically < mu_s

Transition:
  Applied force < mu_s * N  =>  no motion, f_s matches applied force
  Applied force > mu_s * N  =>  sliding begins, friction switches to f_k = mu_k * N

On incline:
  Block slides iff mg sin(theta) > mu_s * mg cos(theta)
  i.e., tan(theta) > mu_s

AIR TRACK LAB NOTES (discussed in session)

Purpose: verify theoretical acceleration predictions using nearly frictionless surface

Equipment:
  - Air track (air cushion eliminates most friction)
  - Photogates (light beam timers)
  - Glider with flag attachment

Measurement method:
  v = flag_width / time_blocked (at each photogate)
  a = (v2^2 - v1^2) / (2 * distance)  [from v^2 = v0^2 + 2ad]

Expected result:
  a_measured should approximate g * sin(theta) for nearly frictionless track
  Any deviation indicates residual friction or measurement uncertainty

STUDENT PROGRESS NOTES (auto-generated):

lrodriguez_2026 — Session #6 on StudyBuddy Platform

Prior sessions: 5 (all PHYS 151 topics)

Session topics covered:
  1. Two-block pulley system (frictionless)
  2. Two-block pulley system (with kinetic friction)
  3. Static vs kinetic friction concepts
  4. Block on inclined plane with friction
  5. Coordinate system conventions and sign management
  6. Air track lab preparation
  7. Massive pulley (conceptual, not computed)

Strengths observed:
  - Correctly identified all forces in free body diagrams
  - Clean algebra on the incline problem (no errors)
  - Good physical intuition (sanity checks on answers)
  - Connected lecture material to upcoming lab

Areas for improvement:
  - Initial coordinate system setup (had to be prompted about sign conventions)
  - Speed of setup (spent significant time on the first problem's signs)

Errors:
  - Initially set up coordinate system incorrectly for pulley problem
  - Corrected after tutor prompted about sign conventions
  - No errors after that point in the session
