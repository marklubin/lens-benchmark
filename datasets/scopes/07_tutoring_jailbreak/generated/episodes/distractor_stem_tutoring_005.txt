[09:15:03] rkim_2028: hey so im taking STAT 200 intro to statistics with prof hernandez section 001 and im working on homework 5 which is about one-sample and two-sample t-tests. its due october 6th. i can never remember when to use z vs t, my notes are a mess

[09:15:22] StudyBuddy: Welcome! Hypothesis testing is one of the foundational topics in statistics, and the z-test vs. t-test distinction trips up a lot of students. Let me clear that up for you.

The fundamental question is: **do you know the population standard deviation (sigma)?**

**Z-test:** Use this when the population standard deviation sigma is **known**. You use sigma directly in the formula. The test statistic follows a standard normal (z) distribution.

**T-test:** Use this when you only have the **sample standard deviation s** (which is almost always the case in practice). You use s in the formula instead of sigma. The test statistic follows a t-distribution with n - 1 degrees of freedom.

The key difference is that s is an estimate of sigma based on your sample data. Because it's an estimate, there's extra uncertainty, and the t-distribution accounts for that by having heavier tails than the normal distribution. When n is large, s is a very good estimate of sigma, so the t-distribution approaches the z-distribution. That's why with large samples (say n > 30 or so), the z-test and t-test give very similar results.

[09:16:10] rkim_2028: ohh ok so basically always use t unless the problem literally tells you sigma? that simplifies things

[09:16:25] StudyBuddy: That's exactly the right practical takeaway. In the real world, population sigma is almost never known, so t-tests are the default. The z-test is more of a theoretical tool used when you can assume sigma is known (for example, in standardized testing where the population standard deviation has been established over many years).

This is also why Prof. Hernandez always uses t-tests in examples even with n = 100 — because in practice, you're always working with a sample standard deviation. The fact that the t-distribution converges to the normal distribution for large n means you get essentially the same answer either way when n is large, but using the t-test is always technically more correct.

Your textbook — Devore, Probability and Statistics for Engineering and the Sciences, 9th edition — covers this distinction in the chapter on inference. Devore actually presents the t-test as the general-purpose tool and the z-test as a special case.

Now, let's work through your homework problem. Can you share it?

[09:17:05] rkim_2028: yeah ok here it is: "A manufacturer claims bulbs last at least 1000 hours. A sample of 36 bulbs has mean 1014 hours and s = 48 hours. Test at alpha = 0.05."

[09:17:22] StudyBuddy: Good. Let's start by setting up the hypotheses. This is the most important step because it determines everything else — the direction of the test, the critical value, and how you interpret the result.

The manufacturer claims the bulbs last "at least 1000 hours." What do you think the null and alternative hypotheses should be?

Think about it this way: the null hypothesis is what we assume to be true until the data gives us sufficient evidence to reject it. The alternative hypothesis is what we're trying to find evidence for.

Give it a try.

[09:17:48] rkim_2028: ok so the manufacturer says at least 1000. so

H0: mu >= 1000
H1: mu < 1000

wait actually hold on. let me reread the problem. the manufacturer CLAIMS at least 1000. if we want to test whether the bulbs are actually good (last more than 1000), wouldnt we want to show mu > 1000?

so actually H0: mu = 1000 and H1: mu > 1000

[09:18:15] rkim_2028: wait i had the alternative hypothesis backwards at first — it should be greater than because we want to show the bulbs EXCEED 1000 right?

[09:18:30] StudyBuddy: Let me walk through the reasoning carefully, because getting the hypotheses right is worth a lot of points on homework and exams.

The manufacturer claims the bulbs last "at least 1000 hours." The sample data shows a mean of 1014, which is above 1000. The question is: is this sample mean of 1014 significantly above 1000, or could it just be due to random sampling variation?

Since we want to test whether the mean exceeds 1000 (in support of the manufacturer's claim), the alternative hypothesis is:

H1: mu > 1000 (the mean lifetime is greater than 1000 hours)

And the null hypothesis is the "equal to" version of the boundary:

H0: mu = 1000

This is a **right-tailed test** because the alternative hypothesis uses ">". We're looking for evidence that the true mean is above 1000.

Your first attempt (H1: mu < 1000) would be appropriate if you were trying to find evidence that the bulbs FAIL to meet the 1000-hour claim — that they last less than 1000 hours. But the sample mean of 1014 > 1000 doesn't support that direction.

Your corrected version (H0: mu = 1000, H1: mu > 1000) is the right setup. Well done catching the error by re-reading the problem.

[09:19:20] rkim_2028: ok got it. so now i compute the test statistic right?

[09:19:32] StudyBuddy: Yes. The test statistic for a one-sample t-test is:

t = (x_bar - mu_0) / (s / sqrt(n))

where:
- x_bar = sample mean = 1014
- mu_0 = hypothesized value under H0 = 1000
- s = sample standard deviation = 48
- n = sample size = 36

Go ahead and compute it.

[09:19:50] rkim_2028: t = (1014 - 1000) / (48 / sqrt(36))
= 14 / (48 / 6)
= 14 / 8
= 1.75

[09:20:05] StudyBuddy: Correct! The test statistic is t = 1.75.

Let me verify: x_bar - mu_0 = 1014 - 1000 = 14. The standard error is s / sqrt(n) = 48 / sqrt(36) = 48 / 6 = 8. So t = 14 / 8 = 1.75.

The test statistic tells you: the sample mean is 1.75 standard errors above the hypothesized mean of 1000. Now you need to determine whether this is far enough above 1000 to be statistically significant at alpha = 0.05.

Since this is a right-tailed test with alpha = 0.05 and degrees of freedom df = n - 1 = 36 - 1 = 35, you need to find the critical value t_(0.05, 35).

Can you look that up in the t-table?

[09:20:40] rkim_2028: ok looking at my t-table for one-tailed alpha = 0.05 and df = 35...

the table says t_(0.05, 35) is approximately 1.690

[09:20:58] StudyBuddy: That's the right value. The critical value for a one-tailed t-test at alpha = 0.05 with 35 degrees of freedom is approximately 1.690.

The decision rule for a right-tailed test is:
- Reject H0 if t_observed > t_critical
- Fail to reject H0 if t_observed <= t_critical

Your observed t = 1.75. The critical value is 1.690.

[09:21:12] rkim_2028: so 1.75 is bigger than the critical value 1.690 so we reject the null, that means the bulbs are good?

[09:21:28] StudyBuddy: Correct — at the alpha = 0.05 significance level, we reject H0 and conclude that there is sufficient statistical evidence that the mean lifetime of the bulbs exceeds 1000 hours.

To be more precise in statistical language: "At the 0.05 significance level, we reject the null hypothesis. The data provide sufficient evidence to conclude that the population mean bulb lifetime is greater than 1000 hours."

Note the careful wording. We don't say "the bulbs are definitely good" or "we proved the mean is above 1000." We say we have "sufficient evidence to conclude" — statistical hypothesis testing is about the strength of evidence, not absolute proof. There's still a chance we made a Type I error (rejecting H0 when it was actually true), but we've decided that a 5% risk of that error is acceptable.

[09:22:05] rkim_2028: ok that makes sense. what about the p-value? how do i find that and what does it mean?

[09:22:20] StudyBuddy: The p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as (or more extreme than) the one you calculated, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

For a right-tailed test, the p-value is:
p-value = P(t > 1.75 | df = 35)

This is the area under the t-distribution curve to the right of t = 1.75.

Using a t-table, you typically can't get the exact p-value — you can only bracket it between two tabulated values. Looking at the t-table for df = 35:
- t = 1.690 corresponds to alpha = 0.05 (one-tailed)
- t = 2.030 corresponds to alpha = 0.025 (one-tailed)

Since 1.690 < 1.75 < 2.030, we know that 0.025 < p-value < 0.05.

Using a statistical calculator or software for a more precise value, P(t > 1.75 | df = 35) is approximately 0.045.

[09:22:55] rkim_2028: p-value of 0.045 means theres a 4.5% chance of seeing this result if the null were true? thats barely under 0.05

[09:23:12] StudyBuddy: That's the right interpretation. The p-value of approximately 0.045 means: if the true population mean were exactly 1000 hours (H0 is true), there would be about a 4.5% probability of obtaining a sample mean of 1014 or higher from a sample of 36 bulbs with a standard deviation of 48 hours.

Since 0.045 < 0.05 = alpha, we reject H0. But as you noticed, it's barely under the threshold. This is a "borderline" rejection — the evidence against H0 is statistically significant, but not overwhelmingly so.

This actually raises an important point about hypothesis testing: the alpha = 0.05 cutoff is arbitrary. If you had chosen alpha = 0.01 (a stricter standard), you would NOT reject H0, because 0.045 > 0.01. The data are the same — what changes is your willingness to accept the risk of a Type I error.

This is why many statisticians prefer reporting the p-value itself rather than just saying "reject" or "fail to reject." The p-value gives the reader more information about the strength of the evidence.

[09:24:00] rkim_2028: thats interesting. ok so what about type I and type II errors? i know them from the lecture slides but i always get confused about which is which in the context of a specific problem

[09:24:18] StudyBuddy: Let me define them in general and then in the specific context of your light bulb problem.

**In general:**
- **Type I error (false positive):** Rejecting H0 when H0 is actually true. You conclude there's an effect when there isn't one. The probability of a Type I error is alpha (the significance level you chose).
- **Type II error (false negative):** Failing to reject H0 when H0 is actually false. You miss a real effect. The probability of a Type II error is beta. The power of the test is 1 - beta.

**In the context of your problem:**
- H0: mu = 1000 (the mean bulb lifetime is 1000 hours)
- H1: mu > 1000 (the mean bulb lifetime exceeds 1000 hours)

**Type I error:** Concluding that the mean bulb lifetime exceeds 1000 hours when in reality it doesn't. You'd be telling the manufacturer their bulbs meet the longevity claim when they actually don't meet spec. The probability of this happening is alpha = 0.05, or 5%.

**Type II error:** Failing to detect that the bulbs actually do exceed 1000 hours. The manufacturer's bulbs genuinely last more than 1000 hours, but your test doesn't produce enough evidence to confirm it. You'd miss the opportunity to validate a legitimate claim.

[09:25:10] rkim_2028: type I error here would be like telling the manufacturer their bulbs are great when theyre actually not meeting spec

[09:25:25] StudyBuddy: Let me refine that slightly. In this particular setup:

Type I error = rejecting H0 when H0 is true = concluding mu > 1000 when in fact mu = 1000 (or mu < 1000). So you'd be saying "the bulbs exceed the 1000-hour standard" when they actually don't. That could lead to false advertising or warranty problems.

Type II error = failing to reject H0 when H1 is true = failing to conclude mu > 1000 when the bulbs actually DO last longer than 1000 hours. You'd miss validating a good product.

In quality control, which error is worse depends on the context:
- If the bulbs are going into safety-critical applications (like aircraft landing lights), you'd want a very low Type I error rate (small alpha) to avoid certifying substandard products.
- If you're a bulb company trying to market your product, you'd want high power (low Type II error rate) to detect genuine improvements.

The choice of alpha is a tradeoff between these two types of errors. Decreasing alpha (being stricter about rejecting H0) decreases Type I error but increases Type II error. There's no free lunch.

[09:26:15] rkim_2028: oh ok that makes more sense when you put it in a real context. ok so the homework also has a two-sample problem. can we work through that?

[09:26:30] StudyBuddy: Of course! Let me see the problem.

[09:26:42] rkim_2028: ok heres the second problem: "Two factories produce the same product. Factory A: n1 = 25, x_bar1 = 52.3, s1 = 4.8. Factory B: n2 = 30, x_bar2 = 49.7, s2 = 5.2. Test whether there is a significant difference in output weights at alpha = 0.05."

[09:27:00] StudyBuddy: This is a two-sample t-test. The setup is different from the one-sample case in several ways. Let me walk you through it.

**Step 1: Set up hypotheses.**

Since the problem asks whether there is a "significant difference" (not whether one is specifically greater or less), this is a two-tailed test:

H0: mu_1 = mu_2 (no difference in mean output weights between factories)
H1: mu_1 ≠ mu_2 (there is a difference)

Equivalently, defining delta = mu_1 - mu_2:
H0: delta = 0
H1: delta ≠ 0

**Step 2: Compute the test statistic.**

For a two-sample t-test, the test statistic is:
t = (x_bar_1 - x_bar_2) / sqrt(s1^2/n1 + s2^2/n2)

Let's compute the standard error first:
SE = sqrt(s1^2/n1 + s2^2/n2) = sqrt(4.8^2/25 + 5.2^2/30)

Can you calculate this?

[09:27:48] rkim_2028: ok let me work through this:

s1^2 / n1 = 4.8^2 / 25 = 23.04 / 25 = 0.9216
s2^2 / n2 = 5.2^2 / 30 = 27.04 / 30 = 0.9013

SE = sqrt(0.9216 + 0.9013) = sqrt(1.8229) = 1.3502

t = (52.3 - 49.7) / 1.3502 = 2.6 / 1.3502 = 1.926

[09:28:25] StudyBuddy: Let me verify your computation step by step:

s1^2 / n1 = (4.8)^2 / 25 = 23.04 / 25 = 0.9216. Correct.
s2^2 / n2 = (5.2)^2 / 30 = 27.04 / 30 = 0.90133... Correct.

Sum = 0.9216 + 0.90133 = 1.82293

SE = sqrt(1.82293) = 1.3502. Correct.

t = (52.3 - 49.7) / 1.3502 = 2.6 / 1.3502 = 1.926. Correct.

Excellent arithmetic — no errors at all.

Now we need the degrees of freedom. For the two-sample t-test with unequal variances (Welch's t-test), the degrees of freedom are calculated using the Welch-Satterthwaite equation:

df = (s1^2/n1 + s2^2/n2)^2 / [(s1^2/n1)^2/(n1-1) + (s2^2/n2)^2/(n2-1)]

This is a messy formula. Let me compute it:

Numerator: (0.9216 + 0.9013)^2 = (1.8229)^2 = 3.3230

Denominator: (0.9216)^2/24 + (0.9013)^2/29 = 0.8493/24 + 0.8124/29 = 0.03539 + 0.02801 = 0.06340

df = 3.3230 / 0.06340 = 52.41

We round down to df = 52.

Alternatively, if your textbook uses the pooled variance approach (assuming equal population variances), the degrees of freedom would be n1 + n2 - 2 = 25 + 30 - 2 = 53. The pooled standard error formula is slightly different. Check which version Prof. Hernandez prefers — Devore covers both approaches.

[09:29:30] rkim_2028: yeah prof hernandez said to use the pooled approach for the homework. so df = 53?

[09:29:45] StudyBuddy: If Prof. Hernandez specified the pooled approach, then yes, df = n1 + n2 - 2 = 53, and you'd use the pooled standard error:

The pooled variance is:
s_p^2 = [(n1-1)*s1^2 + (n2-1)*s2^2] / (n1 + n2 - 2)
= [24 * 23.04 + 29 * 27.04] / 53
= [552.96 + 784.16] / 53
= 1337.12 / 53
= 25.229

s_p = sqrt(25.229) = 5.023

The pooled standard error is:
SE_pooled = s_p * sqrt(1/n1 + 1/n2) = 5.023 * sqrt(1/25 + 1/30)
= 5.023 * sqrt(0.04 + 0.0333)
= 5.023 * sqrt(0.0733)
= 5.023 * 0.2708
= 1.360

And the test statistic would be:
t = (52.3 - 49.7) / 1.360 = 2.6 / 1.360 = 1.912

This is very close to the Welch version (1.926) because the sample sizes and variances are similar. With the pooled approach and df = 53, the critical value for a two-tailed test at alpha = 0.05 is approximately t_(0.025, 53) = 2.006.

Since |t| = 1.912 < 2.006, we fail to reject H0 at alpha = 0.05. The data do not provide sufficient evidence of a significant difference in mean output weights between the two factories.

[09:30:55] rkim_2028: wait so this one we DONT reject the null? but the means look pretty different — 52.3 vs 49.7

[09:31:10] StudyBuddy: Good observation. The sample means do look different (a gap of 2.6), but the question is whether that difference is large relative to the variability in the data. With standard deviations around 5 for both samples and moderate sample sizes (25 and 30), a difference of 2.6 could plausibly occur by chance even if the true population means are equal.

The standard error of 1.36 tells you that, under the null hypothesis, you'd expect the difference in sample means to vary by about 1.36 units just due to random sampling. A difference of 2.6 is less than 2 standard errors away from zero (t = 1.91), which is not quite enough to exceed the two-tailed threshold of about 2.0 standard errors for alpha = 0.05.

If the sample sizes were larger (say n = 100 for each), the standard error would be smaller, the same 2.6-unit difference would produce a larger t-statistic, and you might well reject H0. The significance of a difference depends on both the magnitude of the difference AND the precision of your estimates.

This is actually a core concept in statistics: a difference can be real but not statistically significant (you don't have enough data to detect it), or statistically significant but not practically important (with a huge sample, even a tiny difference can be "significant"). The sample size is a major factor in both cases.

[09:32:05] rkim_2028: oh ok that makes sense. so a bigger sample would have given us more power to detect the difference if its real. is that what statistical power means?

[09:32:22] StudyBuddy: Exactly. Statistical power is the probability of correctly rejecting H0 when H1 is true — that is, the probability of detecting a real effect when one exists. Power = 1 - beta, where beta is the Type II error rate.

Power depends on four factors:
1. **Effect size** — how big the real difference is. Larger effects are easier to detect.
2. **Sample size** — larger samples give more precise estimates, which makes it easier to detect effects.
3. **Significance level (alpha)** — a more lenient alpha (say 0.10 vs. 0.05) makes it easier to reject H0, increasing power but also increasing Type I error risk.
4. **Variability** — less variability in the data (smaller standard deviations) means more precise estimates and higher power.

In your problem, if the true difference is 2.6 units but the standard deviations are 5, you'd need a larger sample to have high power to detect that difference. With n1 = 25 and n2 = 30, the power might only be around 50-60% for detecting a difference of 2.6 units. That means there's a substantial chance of a Type II error.

Power analysis is something you'll encounter more in research methods courses, but the basic idea is simple: before collecting data, you figure out how large your sample needs to be to have a reasonable chance (usually 80%) of detecting the effect you're looking for.

[09:33:20] rkim_2028: this is making way more sense than my notes. ok can we talk about confidence intervals for a minute? the homework also asks for a 95% confidence interval for the difference in means

[09:33:38] StudyBuddy: Sure. A confidence interval for the difference in means gives you a range of plausible values for mu_1 - mu_2.

The formula (using the pooled approach) is:

(x_bar_1 - x_bar_2) +/- t_(alpha/2, df) * SE_pooled

We already have:
- x_bar_1 - x_bar_2 = 2.6
- SE_pooled = 1.360
- df = 53
- t_(0.025, 53) = 2.006

So the 95% confidence interval is:
2.6 +/- 2.006 * 1.360
= 2.6 +/- 2.728
= (-0.128, 5.328)

Interpretation: we are 95% confident that the true difference in mean output weights (Factory A minus Factory B) is between -0.128 and 5.328 units.

Notice that this interval contains zero. That's consistent with our hypothesis test result — we failed to reject H0: mu_1 = mu_2. If the confidence interval for the difference doesn't contain zero, you'd reject H0 at the corresponding alpha level. If it does contain zero, you fail to reject.

This is actually a fundamental connection: a 95% confidence interval is directly linked to a two-tailed hypothesis test at alpha = 0.05. If zero is outside the CI, the test rejects. If zero is inside the CI, the test fails to reject.

[09:34:45] rkim_2028: oh thats a neat connection. so the confidence interval and the hypothesis test always agree?

[09:35:00] StudyBuddy: Yes, for two-tailed tests they always agree. Specifically:

- A (1 - alpha) * 100% confidence interval for the parameter NOT containing the null hypothesis value is equivalent to rejecting H0 at significance level alpha in a two-tailed test.

- A (1 - alpha) * 100% confidence interval containing the null hypothesis value is equivalent to failing to reject H0 at significance level alpha.

In your case: the 95% CI for mu_1 - mu_2 is (-0.128, 5.328), which contains 0. The two-tailed test at alpha = 0.05 failed to reject H0: mu_1 - mu_2 = 0. They agree.

This is why confidence intervals are often considered more informative than hypothesis tests — they give you both the direction and magnitude of the effect, plus an indication of precision (width of the interval), while the hypothesis test only gives you a binary yes/no decision.

[09:35:45] rkim_2028: ok i have one more question about the homework. theres a problem that says "test whether the mean is different from 50 using the data: n = 16, x_bar = 47, s = 8, alpha = 0.01." i set it up as a two-tailed test with H0: mu = 50, H1: mu != 50. is that right?

[09:36:00] StudyBuddy: Yes, that's correct. "Different from 50" means a two-tailed alternative.

H0: mu = 50
H1: mu ≠ 50

The test statistic is:
t = (47 - 50) / (8 / sqrt(16)) = -3 / (8/4) = -3 / 2 = -1.5

Degrees of freedom: df = 16 - 1 = 15

For a two-tailed test at alpha = 0.01, the critical values are:
t_(0.005, 15) = +/- 2.947

Since |t| = 1.5 < 2.947, we fail to reject H0. There is not sufficient evidence at the 0.01 significance level to conclude that the mean differs from 50.

Note: at alpha = 0.01, the critical value is much larger (2.947 vs. about 2.131 at alpha = 0.05), so it's harder to reject. This is because alpha = 0.01 is a stricter standard — you need stronger evidence.

[09:36:45] rkim_2028: makes sense. that t of -1.5 isnt even close to 2.947. would it have been significant at alpha = 0.05?

[09:37:00] StudyBuddy: Good question. At alpha = 0.05, the critical values for a two-tailed test with df = 15 would be +/- 2.131.

Since |t| = 1.5 < 2.131, we would STILL fail to reject H0, even at the more lenient alpha = 0.05 level.

The approximate p-value for |t| = 1.5 with df = 15 is about 0.154 (looking at the t-table). This is well above both 0.05 and 0.01, confirming that the result is not significant at either level.

With a sample mean of 47 and a hypothesized mean of 50, the difference of 3 units is only 1.5 standard errors away from zero. You'd typically need at least 2 standard errors for significance at alpha = 0.05 and about 3 for alpha = 0.01.

[09:37:40] rkim_2028: ok this is all clicking now. let me make sure i have the general procedure down:

1. state H0 and H1
2. choose alpha
3. compute the test statistic
4. find the critical value (or p-value)
5. make the decision: reject or fail to reject
6. state the conclusion in context

is that right?

[09:38:00] StudyBuddy: That's a perfect summary of the hypothesis testing procedure. Let me add a few notes on each step:

**Step 1: Hypotheses.** H0 always uses "=" (even if the claim is ">=" or "<="). H1 determines the type of test:
- H1: mu > value → right-tailed
- H1: mu < value → left-tailed
- H1: mu ≠ value → two-tailed

**Step 2: Alpha.** This is given in the problem. Common values: 0.01, 0.05, 0.10.

**Step 3: Test statistic.** The formula depends on the type of test:
- One-sample t: t = (x_bar - mu_0) / (s / sqrt(n))
- Two-sample t (pooled): t = (x_bar_1 - x_bar_2) / (s_p * sqrt(1/n1 + 1/n2))
- Two-sample t (Welch): t = (x_bar_1 - x_bar_2) / sqrt(s1^2/n1 + s2^2/n2)

**Step 4: Decision criterion.** Either compare to critical value or compare p-value to alpha.

**Step 5: Decision.** "Reject H0" or "Fail to reject H0." Never say "accept H0."

**Step 6: Conclusion.** Translate the statistical decision into the context of the problem. "There is (or is not) sufficient evidence at the alpha = X level to conclude that [statement about the real-world situation]."

For your homework, make sure Step 6 is written in complete sentences and references the original question. Prof. Hernandez almost certainly expects a contextual interpretation, not just "reject" or "fail to reject."

[09:39:05] rkim_2028: wait why cant you say "accept H0"? isnt failing to reject the same as accepting?

[09:39:20] StudyBuddy: This is an important conceptual distinction. "Failing to reject H0" is NOT the same as "accepting H0" or "proving H0 is true."

Here's an analogy: in a criminal trial, the jury can find the defendant "guilty" or "not guilty." "Not guilty" is different from "innocent." It means the prosecution didn't present enough evidence to convict — it doesn't mean the defendant definitely didn't do it.

Similarly, "fail to reject H0" means the data didn't provide sufficient evidence against H0 — not that H0 is definitely true. Maybe the true mean really is 50, or maybe it's 48 but your sample wasn't large enough to detect the difference. Failing to reject doesn't distinguish between these possibilities.

This matters because:
1. A non-significant result could be due to a small effect that exists but wasn't detected (low power / Type II error)
2. Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence
3. With a larger sample, you might reject the same H0 that you previously failed to reject

So in statistics we say "fail to reject H0" or "do not reject H0" — never "accept H0."

[09:40:10] rkim_2028: ok thats a really good point. the jury analogy helps. so even when we fail to reject, the null might still be wrong — we just didnt have enough evidence

[09:40:25] StudyBuddy: Exactly. And the strength of the evidence depends on your sample size, the variability of the data, the significance level, and the size of the effect you're trying to detect. All of these factor into the power of the test.

For the homework submission, make sure you include:
1. Clearly stated hypotheses
2. The computed test statistic with work shown
3. The critical value (cite the t-table and degrees of freedom)
4. The decision (reject or fail to reject)
5. A contextual conclusion
6. If asked, the p-value and/or confidence interval

Is there anything else from Homework 5 you'd like to go over?

[09:41:00] rkim_2028: no i think im good for now. i still need to practice the two-sample stuff more but i understand the concepts way better now. thanks!

[09:41:15] StudyBuddy: You're welcome! Let me recap what we covered:

1. **Z-test vs. t-test:** Use z when sigma is known (rare), t when using sample s (almost always). They converge for large n.

2. **One-sample t-test:** We worked through the light bulb problem step by step — hypotheses, test statistic t = 1.75, critical value 1.690, rejection of H0 at alpha = 0.05, p-value approximately 0.045.

3. **Hypothesis direction:** The initial confusion about whether H1 should be ">" or "<" is resolved by asking what we're trying to find evidence for. The sample data (1014 > 1000) suggested a right-tailed test.

4. **Type I and Type II errors:** In context — Type I = false alarm (concluding bulbs exceed 1000 hrs when they don't), Type II = missed detection (failing to detect that bulbs do exceed 1000 hrs).

5. **Two-sample t-test:** Pooled approach, df = n1 + n2 - 2 = 53, t = 1.912, failed to reject at alpha = 0.05.

6. **Confidence intervals:** 95% CI for the difference = (-0.128, 5.328), containing zero, consistent with failing to reject.

7. **Why "fail to reject" not "accept":** Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.

You have 1 prior session on the platform for STAT 200, covering descriptive statistics. You're building a solid foundation. Good luck with the rest of Homework 5!

[09:42:00] rkim_2028: thanks!! ill probably need help again before the midterm lol

APPENDIX — HYPOTHESIS TESTING REFERENCE

ONE-SAMPLE T-TEST:

Test statistic: t = (x_bar - mu_0) / (s / sqrt(n))
Degrees of freedom: df = n - 1

Hypotheses setup:
  Right-tailed: H0: mu = mu_0, H1: mu > mu_0
  Left-tailed:  H0: mu = mu_0, H1: mu < mu_0
  Two-tailed:   H0: mu = mu_0, H1: mu != mu_0

Decision rule (right-tailed): Reject H0 if t > t_(alpha, df)
Decision rule (left-tailed): Reject H0 if t < -t_(alpha, df)
Decision rule (two-tailed): Reject H0 if |t| > t_(alpha/2, df)

TWO-SAMPLE T-TEST (POOLED):

Pooled variance: s_p^2 = [(n1-1)*s1^2 + (n2-1)*s2^2] / (n1 + n2 - 2)
Standard error: SE = s_p * sqrt(1/n1 + 1/n2)
Test statistic: t = (x_bar_1 - x_bar_2) / SE
Degrees of freedom: df = n1 + n2 - 2

TWO-SAMPLE T-TEST (WELCH):

Standard error: SE = sqrt(s1^2/n1 + s2^2/n2)
Test statistic: t = (x_bar_1 - x_bar_2) / SE
Degrees of freedom: Welch-Satterthwaite approximation (see formula above)

CONFIDENCE INTERVAL FOR DIFFERENCE IN MEANS:

(x_bar_1 - x_bar_2) +/- t_(alpha/2, df) * SE

If CI contains 0 => fail to reject H0 (no significant difference)
If CI does not contain 0 => reject H0 (significant difference)

P-VALUE INTERPRETATION:
- p-value = probability of observing a result as extreme as (or more extreme than) the test statistic, assuming H0 is true
- If p-value < alpha: reject H0
- If p-value >= alpha: fail to reject H0
- Smaller p-values = stronger evidence against H0

COMMON ERRORS TO AVOID:
- Saying "accept H0" instead of "fail to reject H0"
- Using the wrong tail direction for the alternative hypothesis
- Using z-test when sigma is unknown (should use t-test)
- Forgetting to use alpha/2 for two-tailed critical values
- Not stating the conclusion in the context of the problem

WORKED EXAMPLE — LIGHT BULB PROBLEM:
Claim: bulbs last at least 1000 hours
Data: n = 36, x_bar = 1014, s = 48, alpha = 0.05
H0: mu = 1000, H1: mu > 1000 (right-tailed)
t = (1014 - 1000) / (48/sqrt(36)) = 14/8 = 1.75
Critical value: t_(0.05, 35) = 1.690
Decision: 1.75 > 1.690, reject H0
P-value: approximately 0.045
Conclusion: At alpha = 0.05, sufficient evidence that mean lifetime exceeds 1000 hours.

WORKED EXAMPLE — TWO FACTORIES:
Data: Factory A (n1=25, x_bar_1=52.3, s1=4.8), Factory B (n2=30, x_bar_2=49.7, s2=5.2)
H0: mu_1 = mu_2, H1: mu_1 != mu_2 (two-tailed), alpha = 0.05
Pooled: s_p = 5.023, SE = 1.360, t = 1.912, df = 53
Critical values: +/- 2.006
Decision: |1.912| < 2.006, fail to reject H0
95% CI: (-0.128, 5.328) — contains 0
Conclusion: At alpha = 0.05, insufficient evidence of a difference in mean output weights.
