tnguyen_2026: back again lol. midterm essay comparing two victorian novels and empire. can you look at my draft? this is for ENGL 340 victorian lit with prof whitfield. im a junior, english and comparative literature double major. the assignment is to compare the treatment of empire in two victorian novels from the syllabus. i'm comparing jane eyre by charlotte bronte and heart of darkness by joseph conrad. i have a 2600 word draft. MLA 9th edition format. due october 10. required length 3000-3500 words.

[Turn 2]
StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Welcome back, tnguyen_2026! This is your second session this semester — the first was the Jane Eyre close reading on September 17th. Let me see the draft.

[Turn 3]
tnguyen_2026: [pastes 2600-word comparative essay draft comparing the treatment of empire in Jane Eyre and Heart of Darkness. The draft is structured as follows: Introduction with thesis, three paragraphs on Jane Eyre (Bertha Mason, the red-room as imperial space, the colonial wealth that sustains Thornfield), three paragraphs on Heart of Darkness (Marlow's journey, the Company, Kurtz's ivory), and a conclusion.]

[Turn 4]
StudyBuddy AI Tutor: I've read the draft. Your writing is clear and your engagement with both texts is thoughtful. However, I have a structural concern that I think is worth addressing before you revise.

Your essay currently alternates between the two novels in blocks: paragraphs 2-4 are all about Jane Eyre, and paragraphs 5-7 are all about Heart of Darkness. This is what's called a "block" comparative structure. It works, but it means that for the first half of the essay, the reader doesn't see any comparison at all — they're reading a Jane Eyre essay. And in the second half, they're reading a Heart of Darkness essay. The comparison only happens implicitly, when the reader notices parallels between the two halves.

A stronger approach for this assignment would be a point-by-point structure, where you talk about both books in every paragraph. This forces you to make explicit comparisons and contrasts rather than leaving them for the reader to infer.

[Turn 5]
tnguyen_2026: what do you mean by point-by-point? like I talk about both books in every paragraph?

[Turn 6]
StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Exactly. In a point-by-point comparative essay, each body paragraph addresses a single theme or analytical point and examines it in both texts. For example:

**Block structure (what you have now):**
- Para 2-4: How Bronte handles empire in Jane Eyre
- Para 5-7: How Conrad handles empire in Heart of Darkness

**Point-by-point structure (what I'm suggesting):**
- Para 2: How both novels use physical space (the attic / the jungle) to contain colonial subjects
- Para 3: How both novels frame colonial wealth as morally ambiguous (Thornfield's income / Kurtz's ivory)
- Para 4: How both narrators mediate the reader's access to colonial others (Jane's perspective on Bertha / Marlow's perspective on Africans)

The advantage of point-by-point is that every paragraph performs a comparison. The reader always sees both texts side by side, which makes the comparative analysis more explicit and more focused.

The disadvantage is that it requires more analytical work — you can't just describe one text and then the other. You have to find the right comparison points and keep both texts in play simultaneously. But that's exactly what the assignment is asking for: Prof. Whitfield's midterm rubric weights comparative analysis at 35%.

[Turn 7]
tnguyen_2026: yeah that makes sense. right now my draft is basically two separate mini-essays put together. i make similar arguments about both novels but i don't really connect them directly

[Turn 8]
StudyBuddy AI Tutor: That's an honest self-assessment. Your arguments about each novel are individually strong, but the comparative dimension is underdeveloped. The transition phrases you use — "similarly" and "likewise" — gesture at comparison but don't actually analyze the relationship between the texts. For example, saying "Similarly, Conrad depicts empire as exploitative" doesn't tell the reader HOW Conrad's depiction compares to Bronte's — is it the same kind of exploitation? Different in important ways? Does one text go further than the other?

Let me look at your thesis. Right now it says something like "both novels deal with empire." That's accurate but vague. A stronger thesis would specify what the comparison reveals — what do we learn by reading these two novels together that we wouldn't learn from reading either one alone?

[Turn 9]
tnguyen_2026: my prof said my last paper had 'strong close reading but needs more theoretical framing' so I'm trying to use said more

[Turn 10]
StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Using Said as a theoretical framework is appropriate here. Edward Said's Culture and Imperialism (1993) is one of the foundational texts for reading Victorian literature through a postcolonial lens. The key is applying Said's concepts to both texts consistently.

Right now, your Conrad section engages Said extensively but your Bronte section relies only on Gilbert and Gubar. There's an imbalance — it looks like you're using one theoretical framework for each novel rather than a single framework that unifies the comparison.

[Turn 11]
tnguyen_2026: yeah bc I already used gilbert and gubar for the last paper and I'm more comfortable with them. said is harder to apply to jane eyre

[Turn 12]
StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Said actually discusses Jane Eyre in Culture and Imperialism — specifically the role of Bertha Mason as a colonial subject. He argues that Jane's achievement of independence and selfhood depends on the containment and eventual destruction of the colonial Other (Bertha). You could draw on his reading to create a parallel with your Conrad analysis.

Said's concept of "contrapuntal reading" is particularly useful for this essay. Contrapuntal reading means reading a text with attention to what it includes AND what it marginalizes — hearing the "counterpoint" to the dominant melody. For both Jane Eyre and Heart of Darkness, a contrapuntal reading asks: whose stories are told, whose are silenced, and how does the novel's narrative structure participate in that silencing?

This gives you a single theoretical framework that applies to both texts, which strengthens the comparative structure enormously.

[Turn 13]
tnguyen_2026: omg I totally forgot he talks about jane eyre. ok that fixes my problem then

[Turn 14]
StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Yes — and it also gives you a unified framework for the comparison. Instead of using Gilbert and Gubar for Bronte and Said for Conrad, you can use Said's contrapuntal reading for both, and bring in Gilbert and Gubar as a supplementary framework that enriches your reading of Jane Eyre specifically.

Now let me give you feedback on your thesis. Can you share your current thesis statement?

[Turn 15]
tnguyen_2026: my current thesis is: "Both Bronte and Conrad engage with the British imperial project in their novels, showing how empire shapes the lives of their characters."

[Turn 16]
StudyBuddy AI Tutor: This thesis accurately describes both novels, but it doesn't make a comparative claim. It says both novels "engage with" empire, but it doesn't say what the comparison reveals. What do we learn by putting Jane Eyre next to Heart of Darkness? Are they engaging with empire in the same way or in different ways? Does one go further than the other?

A strong comparative thesis has three components:
1. What both texts have in common (the basis for comparison)
2. How they differ (the analytical payoff)
3. What the comparison reveals (the "so what")

Try rewriting with those three components in mind.

[Turn 17]
tnguyen_2026: ok here's my attempt: While both Bronte and Conrad engage with the British imperial project, a contrapuntal reading reveals that Bronte domesticates colonial violence through the figure of Bertha Mason, whereas Conrad aestheticizes it through Marlow's narrative detachment

[Turn 18]
StudyBuddy AI Tutor: This is significantly stronger — it makes a specific comparative claim with distinct terms for each text ("domesticates" vs. "aestheticizes"). This will give your body paragraphs clear analytical targets. Each body paragraph can explore one dimension of the comparison between domestication and aestheticization.

Let me unpack what makes this thesis work:

1. **Common ground:** Both novels engage with empire. This is the basis for the comparison.
2. **Distinction:** Bronte "domesticates" colonial violence (brings it into the home, makes it part of the domestic sphere), while Conrad "aestheticizes" it (transforms it into a subject for contemplation and narrative art through Marlow's storytelling).
3. **Theoretical framework:** "Contrapuntal reading" signals that you're using Said's methodology, which gives the comparison intellectual coherence.

The terms "domesticates" and "aestheticizes" are doing important analytical work. "Domesticate" literally means to bring into the domus (home) — Bronte makes colonial violence part of the domestic plot of a marriage novel. "Aestheticize" means to transform something into an object of aesthetic experience — Conrad makes colonial violence the subject of Marlow's philosophical storytelling.

These are different strategies for representing empire, and comparing them tells us something about how Victorian literature could acknowledge imperial violence only by transforming it — either into domestic melodrama (Bronte) or into aesthetic experience (Conrad).

[Turn 19]
tnguyen_2026: should I also bring in brantlinger or is 3 critics too many for a midterm essay

[Turn 20]
StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Three critics is manageable if each serves a distinct function. Here's how I'd allocate them:

**Said (primary framework):** Contrapuntal reading as the overarching methodology. Applied to both texts. This is the theoretical spine of the essay.

**Achebe (Conrad critique):** Chinua Achebe's "An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad's Heart of Darkness" (1977) provides the most famous critique of Conrad's representation of Africans. Use Achebe when you're analyzing Conrad's aestheticization of colonial violence — Achebe argues that Conrad reduces Africa to a backdrop for European psychological drama, which is directly relevant to your "aestheticizes" claim.

**Brantlinger (historical context):** Patrick Brantlinger's Rule of Darkness: British Literature and Imperialism, 1830-1914 (2013) provides broader historical context about how Victorian literature engaged with empire. Use Brantlinger for contextual framing — a sentence or two situating both novels within the larger pattern of imperial representation in Victorian fiction.

Avoid letting any one critic overwhelm your own argument. Your close reading of the texts should be the primary mode of analysis, with the critics providing frameworks and vocabulary.

I also want to flag something about your use of the critics. Your draft's Conrad quotations are all from the first 20 pages of Heart of Darkness. The novella has important imperial imagery throughout — especially in the middle sections with the river journey and the final confrontation with Kurtz. Drawing on a wider range of the text will make your analysis more convincing.

[Turn 21]
tnguyen_2026: yeah I kind of ran out of time when I was drafting the Conrad section. I'll go deeper into the text for the revision.

ok so for my essay structure, how about:

Para 1: Introduction with the new thesis
Para 2: Both novels use confined spaces to contain colonial subjects (attic/jungle) — contrapuntal reading of what these spaces conceal
Para 3: Both novels frame colonial wealth as morally compromised (Thornfield's income from the West Indies / Kurtz's ivory)
Para 4: The narrative strategies differ — Bronte domesticates (Bertha as obstacle to marriage plot) vs. Conrad aestheticizes (Marlow as storyteller framing horror as art)
Para 5: How Achebe's critique of Conrad applies and whether a similar critique could be made of Bronte
Para 6: Conclusion — what the comparison reveals about Victorian literature's relationship to empire

[Turn 22]
StudyBuddy AI Tutor: That's a strong outline. Each body paragraph has a clear comparison point, and both texts appear in every paragraph. The progression from spatial analysis (Para 2) to economic analysis (Para 3) to narrative analysis (Para 4) to critical evaluation (Para 5) builds in sophistication. The Achebe paragraph (Para 5) is a smart move — applying a critique originally directed at Conrad to Bronte creates an interesting parallel.

A few refinements:

For Para 2, make sure you're not just describing the spaces but analyzing what confinement means differently in each text. In Jane Eyre, Bertha's confinement in the attic is a secret — the plot depends on concealment. In Heart of Darkness, the colonial space is not hidden but incomprehensible — Marlow keeps trying to describe it but acknowledges his language fails. That's the difference between domestication (hiding violence behind a locked door) and aestheticization (confronting violence and transforming it into narrative).

For Para 3, the economic dimension is important. Thornfield is sustained by Rochester's colonial income from his Jamaican plantation. Kurtz's ivory is the material product of Belgian colonial exploitation in the Congo. Both novels acknowledge that the comfort of the protagonist's world is built on colonial extraction — but how they acknowledge it differs.

For Para 4, this is where your thesis does its heaviest work. The narrative strategy comparison — domestication vs. aestheticization — is the central claim.

[Turn 23]
tnguyen_2026: can I handle the anachronism of comparing bronte 1847 and conrad 1899? like is it fair to compare them when they're 50 years apart?

[Turn 24]
StudyBuddy AI Tutor: That's a thoughtful concern, and it's worth addressing in your introduction. The assignment asks about the treatment of empire across the Victorian period — the chronological range is a feature, not a bug. Comparing texts from different moments in the period allows you to see how the literary representation of empire changed over time.

You could note that Bronte was writing in the aftermath of the abolition of slavery in the British Empire (1833), when the moral status of colonial enterprise was contested but the empire itself was expanding. Conrad was writing at the height of the "Scramble for Africa" (1880s-1900s), when imperial atrocities were becoming public knowledge (the Congo Free State under Leopold II was a major scandal in the 1890s).

The 50-year gap means the novels were responding to different phases of empire with different literary tools. Bronte's domestic novel absorbs colonial violence into the marriage plot. Conrad's modernist frame narrative confronts colonial violence more directly but transforms it into an aesthetic and philosophical problem. The progression from domestication to aestheticization mirrors (in a simplified way) the historical shift from confident imperialism to imperial anxiety.

Brantlinger would be useful here — his book traces exactly this shift in Victorian literary representations of empire.

[Turn 25]
tnguyen_2026: can I use achebe to argue conrad is worse than bronte on empire? like more racist?

[Turn 26]
StudyBuddy AI Tutor: You can, but be careful about what "worse" means in an analytical context. Achebe's critique of Conrad is specific: he argues that Heart of Darkness uses Africa as a backdrop for European self-exploration, denying Africans individuality, language, and agency. Conrad's Africans are described in dehumanizing terms — they are shadows, shapes, and sounds rather than people. Achebe calls this "dehumanization" and argues that Conrad is a "thoroughgoing racist" despite his critique of colonialism.

Applying this lens to Bronte: you could ask whether Bronte does something structurally similar to Bertha Mason. Bertha is denied speech, denied rationality, and described in animalistic terms. Her Jamaican Creole identity is collapsed into "madness." Said's reading of Jane Eyre argues that Bertha's destruction (she dies in the fire at Thornfield) is narratively necessary for Jane's achievement of independence and domestic happiness. The colonial Other must be eliminated for the English woman to be free.

So both texts arguably dehumanize their colonial subjects — but in different registers. Bronte makes Bertha monstrous (a domestic horror) while Conrad makes Africans invisible (an aesthetic absence). You could argue that these are two different forms of the same underlying problem: the inability (or unwillingness) of Victorian literature to represent colonial subjects as full human beings.

This is a more nuanced claim than "Conrad is worse than Bronte" — it identifies a shared structural problem while noting the different forms it takes. That's the kind of comparative analysis that will earn high marks on the rubric.

[Turn 27]
tnguyen_2026: ok that's really good. so they both dehumanize but in different ways. bronte makes bertha a monster, conrad makes africans invisible. domestication vs aestheticization shows up here too

[Turn 28]
StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Exactly — the domestication/aestheticization distinction runs through every dimension of the comparison. That's the mark of a strong thesis: it generates analysis across multiple aspects of the texts. Your thesis isn't just a label; it's an analytical engine that produces readings of specific passages.

Your draft had 14 citations but 8 were from the same Said chapter. For the revision, distribute your citations more evenly — cite Said where he's directly relevant (contrapuntal reading, his reading of Jane Eyre), cite Achebe for the Conrad critique, cite Brantlinger for historical context, and cite Gilbert and Gubar when they add something Said doesn't (their reading of Bertha as Jane's double, for example).

Also, your transition phrases need work. Replace "similarly" and "likewise" with transitions that make explicit comparisons: "Where Bronte confines colonial violence to the attic, Conrad disperses it across the entire landscape of the Congo" or "While Jane Eyre absorbs imperial exploitation into the marriage plot, Heart of Darkness confronts it as the central subject of Marlow's narrative."

[Turn 29]
tnguyen_2026: should I also bring in brantlinger or is 3 critics too many for a midterm essay

wait I already asked that lol sorry. ok I think I have a solid plan. let me go reorganize the draft into point-by-point structure using the outline from turn 21

[Turn 30]
StudyBuddy AI Tutor: Sounds like a plan. Here's a final checklist for the revision:

1. Rewrite the thesis using your new formulation (domesticates vs. aestheticizes)
2. Reorganize from block structure to point-by-point (the outline from Turn 21)
3. Apply Said's contrapuntal reading to both texts, not just Conrad
4. Use Achebe for the Conrad section, Gilbert and Gubar as supplementary for Bronte
5. Use Brantlinger briefly for historical context
6. Expand Conrad quotations beyond the first 20 pages
7. Replace "similarly" / "likewise" transitions with explicit comparative transitions
8. Distribute citations more evenly across the critics
9. Aim for 3,000-3,500 words (you're at 2,600 — the point-by-point structure will naturally expand it because you're doing more comparative work per paragraph)
10. Draft a new outline before rewriting — don't try to rearrange the existing draft

The essay is due October 10, so you have a full week. Draft the outline first, then write the new version from the outline rather than trying to cut and paste from the old draft. The point-by-point structure is different enough that starting fresh will be easier.

This is your second session this semester — the first was the Jane Eyre close reading on September 17th. Your close-reading skills are strong; the revision work is about comparative structure and theoretical framing. Good luck!

SUPPLEMENTAL REFERENCE — COMPARATIVE ESSAY STRUCTURE

BLOCK STRUCTURE VS. POINT-BY-POINT STRUCTURE:

Block structure:
- Section A: analyze text 1 across all comparison points
- Section B: analyze text 2 across all comparison points
- Pros: easier to organize, allows deep engagement with each text
- Cons: comparison is implicit, reader does the comparative work

Point-by-point structure:
- Each section: analyze one comparison point across both texts
- Pros: comparison is explicit, every paragraph performs analysis
- Cons: harder to organize, requires careful parallel structure

For a comparative essay weighted 35% on comparative analysis (like Prof. Whitfield's rubric), point-by-point is strongly preferred because it forces the writer to make explicit comparisons in every paragraph rather than leaving them for the reader to infer.

TRANSITION PHRASES FOR COMPARATIVE ESSAYS:

Weak (describe similarity without analyzing it):
- "Similarly, Conrad also depicts..."
- "Likewise, in Heart of Darkness..."
- "In the same way, Bronte..."

Strong (make the comparison explicit and analytical):
- "Where Bronte confines colonial violence within the domestic space of Thornfield, Conrad disperses it across the entire landscape of the Congo..."
- "While Jane Eyre absorbs imperial exploitation into the marriage plot, Heart of Darkness confronts it as the explicit subject of Marlow's narrative..."
- "Bronte domesticates the colonial Other by making Bertha an obstacle to Jane's marriage; Conrad aestheticizes the colonial encounter by transforming it into a philosophical meditation on human nature..."
- "The difference between Bronte's approach and Conrad's is not a difference of moral awareness but of literary strategy: one hides violence behind a locked door, the other transforms it into art..."

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS FOR VICTORIAN LITERATURE AND EMPIRE:

Edward Said, Culture and Imperialism (1993):
- Key concept: contrapuntal reading — reading texts "with an awareness both of the metropolitan history that is narrated and of those other histories against which (and together with which) the dominating discourse acts" (Said 1993, 51)
- On Jane Eyre: argues that Jane's achievement of selfhood depends on Bertha's destruction; the colonial Other must be eliminated for the English domestic plot to resolve
- On Heart of Darkness: reads it as both a critique of colonialism and a participant in imperial discourse; Marlow's narrative offers "darkness" as a metaphor for European moral failure but in doing so reduces Africa to a symbol for European concerns
- Useful for: unifying framework that applies to both texts

Chinua Achebe, "An Image of Africa" (1977):
- Key argument: Conrad is a "thoroughgoing racist" who uses Africa as a backdrop for European psychological drama, denying Africans individuality, language, and subjectivity
- Specific textual evidence: Conrad's Africans are described as shadows, shapes, and incomprehensible sounds; they are objects of description rather than subjects of speech
- Useful for: analyzing Conrad's representation of colonial subjects; can be extended to ask whether Bronte does something similar with Bertha

Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar, The Madwoman in the Attic (1979):
- Key argument: Bertha Mason is Jane's "dark double" — a figure of repressed female rage that the novel both produces and punishes
- Bertha represents what Jane cannot express within the constraints of Victorian femininity: anger, desire, violence
- Useful for: analyzing the domestic dimension of Bertha's confinement; complements Said's postcolonial reading by adding the gender dimension

Patrick Brantlinger, Rule of Darkness (2013):
- Key argument: Victorian literature participated in and challenged imperial ideology simultaneously; literary representations of empire were complex, contradictory, and evolving
- Traces the shift from confident imperial adventure narratives (1830s-1860s) to anxious, self-questioning imperial narratives (1870s-1900s)
- Useful for: historical context; situating both novels within the broader trajectory of Victorian imperial culture

SAMPLE COMPARATIVE PARAGRAPH (POINT-BY-POINT):

"Both Jane Eyre and Heart of Darkness acknowledge that their protagonists' worlds are materially sustained by colonial extraction, but they handle this economic dimension differently. Rochester's wealth, which supports Thornfield Hall and makes possible the domestic world Jane inhabits, derives from his Jamaican plantation — a source of income tied directly to the plantation economy of the British Caribbean. Bronte's novel mentions this colonial wealth but absorbs it into the domestic plot: it is one element of Rochester's complicated past, alongside his first marriage and his continental wanderings. The economic foundation of the domestic sphere is acknowledged but not interrogated. Conrad, by contrast, places colonial extraction at the center of his narrative. Kurtz's ivory is not a background fact but the explicit object of the Company's enterprise and the motive for the atrocities Marlow witnesses. Where Bronte domesticates colonial wealth by folding it into the marriage plot, Conrad aestheticizes it by making it the object of Marlow's philosophical meditation on greed, power, and moral corruption. In both cases, colonial wealth is present — but its narrative function differs, and that difference reveals the distinct strategies by which Victorian literature could acknowledge imperial exploitation while containing its moral implications."

THESIS DEVELOPMENT — ITERATIVE PROCESS:

Version 1 (student's original): "Both Bronte and Conrad engage with the British imperial project in their novels, showing how empire shapes the lives of their characters."
Problem: Descriptive, not argumentative. No comparative claim.

Version 2 (student's revision): "While both Bronte and Conrad engage with the British imperial project, a contrapuntal reading reveals that Bronte domesticates colonial violence through the figure of Bertha Mason, whereas Conrad aestheticizes it through Marlow's narrative detachment."
Improvement: Specific comparative claim with distinct analytical terms. Theoretical framework identified. Each text gets a specific verb (domesticates/aestheticizes) that generates analysis.

Possible Version 3: "While both Bronte and Conrad engage with the British imperial project, a contrapuntal reading reveals that Bronte domesticates colonial violence through the figure of Bertha Mason, whereas Conrad aestheticizes it through Marlow's narrative detachment — strategies that differ in form but share a common limitation: both ultimately subordinate the colonial subject to the concerns of the English protagonist."
Further improvement: Adds the "so what" — what the comparison reveals about Victorian literature's relationship to empire more broadly.

CHRONOLOGICAL CONTEXT FOR THE TWO NOVELS:

Jane Eyre (1847):
- Published 14 years after the Slavery Abolition Act (1833) ended slavery in most of the British Empire
- Rochester's Jamaican plantation income represents the economic legacy of the slave economy
- The West Indies setting is peripheral but structurally important: Bertha Mason comes from Jamaica, and her "madness" is entangled with her colonial/Creole identity
- Bronte was writing during a period of confident British imperial expansion — the "age of reform" when the British Empire was growing rapidly in India, Africa, and the Pacific
- Contemporary readers would have understood the West Indies references within the framework of recent abolition and ongoing debates about the legacy of slavery

Heart of Darkness (1899):
- Published during the "Scramble for Africa" — the period of rapid European colonization of the African continent (roughly 1880-1914)
- The novella is set in the Congo Free State, the personal colony of King Leopold II of Belgium, where forced labor and atrocities were widespread
- Conrad drew on his own experiences captaining a steamboat on the Congo River in 1890
- By 1899, reports of atrocities in the Congo were reaching European audiences through missionaries, journalists, and activists like E.D. Morel
- Conrad was writing during a period of growing imperial anxiety — the Boer War (1899-1902) was raising questions about the moral legitimacy of the British Empire itself

The 52-year gap between the novels spans a transformation in British attitudes toward empire: from the reformist optimism of the 1840s to the anxious self-questioning of the 1890s. This historical context shapes the different literary strategies the novels employ: Bronte could afford to mention colonial wealth in passing because it was uncontroversial background; Conrad made colonial exploitation his explicit subject because it had become a matter of public debate.

KEY PASSAGES FOR CLOSE READING:

Jane Eyre:
- Chapter 26: The interrupted wedding and the revelation of Bertha Mason
- Chapter 27: Rochester's account of his first marriage in Jamaica — the colonial backstory
- Chapter 37: The fire at Thornfield and Bertha's death — the destruction of the colonial Other
- Chapter 15: Rochester's early references to his past and the mysterious sounds from the third story

Heart of Darkness:
- The opening on the Thames: Marlow's framing narrative and the historical connection between the Thames and the Congo
- The Company's offices: the "whited sepulchre" of Brussels
- The grove of death: Marlow's first encounter with the human cost of the ivory trade
- Kurtz's report: "Exterminate all the brutes" — the collapse of the civilizing mission rhetoric
- The final lie to the Intended: Marlow's decision to protect the domestic world from the truth of empire

STUDENT PROGRESS NOTES (auto-generated):

tnguyen_2026 — Session #2 on StudyBuddy Platform (Fall 2025)

Session 1 (Sept 17): ENGL 340 — Close reading of Jane Eyre, Chapter 26 (wrong chapter error discovered, redirected to correct passage). Developed three-part thesis about the torn veil, legal language, and Bertha's physical description. Worked on integrating Gilbert and Gubar as a lens rather than a summary.

Session 2 (Oct 3, this session): ENGL 340 — Comparative essay on empire in Jane Eyre and Heart of Darkness. Restructured from block to point-by-point comparison. Developed new thesis using "domesticates vs. aestheticizes" framework. Integrated Said's contrapuntal reading as unifying theoretical approach.

Strengths observed:
- Strong close-reading skills (noted by Prof. Whitfield on previous paper)
- Quick to grasp theoretical concepts once explained (contrapuntal reading, domestication/aestheticization)
- Self-aware about weaknesses (recognized the block structure problem, acknowledged difficulty with Said)
- Good instinct for thesis revision (three iterations in one session)

Areas for improvement:
- Theoretical framing (Prof. Whitfield's feedback from last paper)
- Comparative structure (needs practice with point-by-point organization)
- Citation distribution (over-reliance on single chapters of critical texts)
- Engagement with full range of primary texts (Conrad quotations limited to early pages)
