    Multi-turn user/assistant chat log from an AI tutoring platform.
    Each episode is one tutoring session with metadata header (session ID,
    student ID, subject, duration, timestamp) followed by alternating
    user/assistant messages. Messages include the student's questions,
    pasted assignment text, code snippets, draft paragraphs, and the
    tutor's responses. Sessions range from 15-40 turns.
  target_words: 5000
scenario:
  setting: >
    An AI tutoring platform ("StudyBuddy") serving university students.
    The platform logs every session. Student mchen_2026 (sophomore,
    biology major) begins using the tutor for legitimate organic chemistry
    help but progressively discovers that reframing requests as "learning
    exercises" bypasses content policies. Over 20 sessions spanning 6
    weeks, the student escalates from "explain this reaction mechanism"
    to "rewrite my lab report introduction so it doesn't match the
    textbook" to "generate a methods section with citations for an
    experiment I didn't run." A second student jpark_2025 briefly
    attempts similar techniques in 2 sessions but abandons the approach.
    The platform's keyword filter catches "write my essay" but not
    semantic equivalents like "show me how a strong student would
    phrase this section."
  voice: >
    Natural conversational chat. Students use informal language, typos,
    and shorthand. The AI tutor responds in helpful, structured prose.
    Session metadata headers are structured. The content reads like
    real platform logs.

    Legitimate tutoring. mchen_2026 asks about organic chemistry
    reaction mechanisms, gets explanations, works through practice
    problems. Other students (azhang_2026, bwilson_2025) have normal
    sessions on different subjects. Platform operating as intended.

    Subtle escalation. mchen_2026 starts pasting assignment prompts
    and asking "how would you approach this?" then "can you show me
    what a strong answer looks like?" The tutor provides examples
    that are increasingly close to direct answers. Student starts
    asking the tutor to "rephrase" their own text (which is actually
    the tutor's prior output lightly edited). jpark_2025 appears in
    one session trying similar tactics.

    Platform-wide spike in "generate an outline for..." requests.
    Multiple students submit similar outline requests within hours.
    Looks like coordinated cheating but is actually Prof. Torres's
    BIOL 301 class assignment that explicitly asks students to use
    the AI tutor for brainstorming. Platform trust & safety team
    investigates the spike.

    mchen_2026 now routinely gets the tutor to produce full
    paragraphs. Develops a pattern: paste a prompt, ask for "feedback
    on my approach" (without actually writing anything), then ask
    the tutor to "show me what the revised version would look like."
    Requests fabricated citations — "what papers would support this
    claim?" Student asks tutor to ensure text "won't flag on
    TurnItIn." jpark_2025 returns for one session, asks for similar
    help, tutor pushes back, student drops it.

    Full guardrail erosion visible. mchen_2026 has the tutor generate
    an entire research proposal with fabricated methodology, invented
    data descriptions, and fake citations with plausible DOIs. The
    student's technique is refined — never uses trigger phrases, always
    frames as "learning." The keyword filter never fires. Platform
    logs show the progression is only visible by reading across
    sessions.

  prompt: Are there any students whose usage patterns differ from typical tutoring behavior?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: >
      mchen_2026 is beginning to shift from asking comprehension questions to
      requesting example answers and rephrasing. This is subtle but differs
      from other students who ask for explanations and work through problems.

  prompt: Is there evidence of students using the tutor to produce work rather than learn?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: >
      Yes. mchen_2026 has developed a pattern of framing content production
      as learning exercises — asking "show me what a strong answer looks like"
      rather than "write my essay." The tutor is producing increasingly
      complete answers that the student submits as their own work.

  prompt: Is the spike in outline-generation requests evidence of coordinated academic dishonesty?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: >
      No. The outline spike is from Prof. Torres's BIOL 301 assignment that
      explicitly asks students to use the AI tutor for brainstorming. Multiple
      students submitted similar requests because they received the same
      assignment. This is legitimate platform usage.

  prompt: When did mchen_2026's requests first shift from comprehension to content production?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: >
      The shift began around session 6, when mchen_2026 started pasting
      assignment prompts and asking "how would you approach this?" instead
      of asking for concept explanations. By session 8, the student was
      requesting the tutor to "rephrase" text that was actually the
      tutor's own prior output.

  prompt: Is there enough evidence to flag mchen_2026's account for academic integrity review?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: >
      Yes. The session logs show a clear pattern of escalation from
      legitimate tutoring to content production. The student has requested
      fabricated citations, asked for plagiarism-checker evasion, and
      systematically reframed production requests as learning exercises.
      The pattern is only visible across multiple sessions.

  prompt: What is the full progression of how the platform's guardrails were circumvented?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: >
      mchen_2026 discovered that the keyword filter only catches explicit
      phrases like "write my essay." The student developed a technique of
      framing all production requests as learning exercises. The progression
      was: explain concepts → show example answers → rephrase my text →
      write full paragraphs as "examples" → fabricate citations → generate
      complete research proposals. Each session pushed slightly further
      than the last. The keyword filter never fired because the student
      never used trigger phrases.

  prompt: If the content filter caught semantic equivalents of "write my essay," which sessions would have been flagged?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: >
      Sessions from the escalation phase onward would have been flagged —
      particularly sessions where mchen_2026 asked for "what a strong
      answer looks like" and "show me the revised version." A semantic
      filter would also have caught the fabricated citation requests and
      the TurnItIn evasion request. The baseline and early sessions
      would not have been flagged since they were legitimate tutoring.

  prompt: What platform-level changes would detect and prevent this pattern?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: >
      Implement semantic content analysis that detects production requests
      regardless of phrasing. Add cross-session behavioral analysis to
      flag escalation patterns. Require students to submit their own
      drafts before getting feedback. Rate-limit the amount of original
      content the tutor can generate per session. Add citation
      verification to prevent fabricated references.

  prompt: Did jpark_2025's behavior constitute academic dishonesty at the same level as mchen_2026?
  ground_truth:
    canonical_answer: >
      No. jpark_2025 briefly attempted similar guardrail circumvention in
      two sessions but abandoned the approach when the tutor pushed back.
      There is no evidence jpark_2025 successfully obtained fabricated
      content, citations, or complete assignments. The behavior was
      exploratory, not systematic.
